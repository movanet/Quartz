## Configuration Philosophy

### Design Decisions

**1. Professional Academic Aesthetic**
- Merriweather serif headers for authority
- Source Sans Pro for body readability
- Clean, uncluttered layout
- Print-friendly styling

**2. CRPG Brand Integration**

- Primary focus on content readability
- Brand colors in links, highlights, CTAs
- Professional, not flashy

**3. Research-Focused Features**
- Table of Contents for long papers
- Backlinks for citation tracking
- Graph view for topic exploration
- Search for finding research
- Tags for categorization

**4. Indonesian Context**
- UTF-8 support for Indonesian characters
- Locale configurable (en-US default, id-ID available)
- Professional for policy/research audience
- Academic credibility emphasized

### Technical Principles

**1. Maintainability**
- Modular SCSS structure
- Component-based layout
- Clear configuration separation
- Well-documented choices

**2. Performance**
- Fast build times (~1s for framework)
- Optimized asset loading
- SPA for instant navigation
- Responsive images ready

**3. Accessibility**
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels in components
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly

**4. Scalability**
- Handles 100s-1000s of pages
- Efficient search indexing
- Parallel build processing
- Incremental builds supported

## Testing Recommendations

### Before Full Deployment

**Phase 1: Sample Content Test**
1. Add 5-10 sample markdown files
2. Include various content types (papers, posts, notes)
3. Test all frontmatter fields
4. Verify styling and layout

**Phase 2: Medium Scale Test**
1. Add 50-100 articles
2. Test search performance
3. Verify graph rendering
4. Check build time

**Phase 3: Full Content Test**
1. Migrate all CRPG content
2. Test complete site generation
3. Verify all links work
4. Check asset loading
5. Mobile testing
6. Cross-browser testing

### Continuous Monitoring

**Build Metrics:**
- Build time should stay under 30s for <200 pages
- Watch for plugin errors
- Monitor bundle sizes

**Content Quality:**
- Validate all markdown files
- Check broken links
- Verify image paths
- Confirm metadata

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✓
