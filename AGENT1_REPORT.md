### Why Scraping Failed

**Technical Reasons:**
1. **403 Forbidden Errors:** Anti-bot protection actively blocking automated requests
2. **Advanced Bot Detection:** Site likely uses Cloudflare, Wordfence, or similar
3. **JavaScript Challenges:** May require JavaScript execution for access
4. **Session/Cookie Validation:** Basic HTTP requests insufficient
5. **Header Fingerprinting:** Despite realistic User-Agent, still detected

**Ethical Considerations:**
- 403 response indicates deliberate blocking by site owner
- Attempting to bypass may violate terms of service
- Could trigger IP bans
- Respectful approach: seek owner cooperation

### Alternative Methods Evaluated

| Method | Feasibility | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|--------|-------------|------|------|----------------|
| **WordPress Export** | High | Complete, official, preserves metadata | Requires owner cooperation | ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED** |
| **REST API** | Medium | Structured data, official method | May be disabled, still subject to blocking | Try as backup |
| **Database Access** | Medium | Complete data | Requires significant trust, sensitive info | Only if export fails |
| **Archive.org** | Low | Public, no permission needed | Incomplete, outdated | Emergency backup only |
| **RSS Feeds** | Low | Easy to parse | Limited to recent posts | Supplementary at best |
| **Sitemap.xml** | Low | URL discovery | Still need to fetch pages (blocked) | URL mapping only |
| **Headless Browser** | Low | Executes JavaScript | Complex, ethical issues, may still fail | Not recommended |
| **Manual Migration** | Medium | Always works | Time-consuming, error-prone | Fallback for critical pages |

### Recommended Approach

**Primary Strategy:** WordPress Export + Owner Cooperation

**Steps:**
1. **Contact site owner** with formal request (template provided)
2. **Request WordPress XML export** (Tools ‚Üí Export ‚Üí All content)
3. **Request media library access** (FTP, plugin, or hosting provider)
4. **Parse WXR XML** to extract posts, pages, metadata
5. **Convert HTML to Markdown** with proper frontmatter
6. **Download and organize assets** (images, PDFs)
7. **Map URL structure** for SEO preservation
8. **Implement redirects** for changed URLs
9. **Quality assurance** review
10. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**

**Fallback:** If export unavailable, attempt REST API access, then selective manual migration
