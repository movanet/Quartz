##  Environmental and Human Rights Due Diligence

CRPG is excited to announce the formation of our EHRDD Consulting Services Group. Established in 2023, this team is dedicated to assisting businesses in navigating the complexities of Environmental and Human Rights Due Diligence. This initiative is in collaboration with Ecoverse and its partners, ensuring we remain at the forefront of environmental sampling and research.

Our foundation is built on the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). We aim to help organizations operate responsibly, with a focus on both environmental respect and upholding human rights standards. We recognize the significant role businesses play in creating a sustainable and equitable world, and our team is here to support that journey.

The EHRDD Consulting Services specializes in the EHRDD process, ensuring businesses identify and address potential environmental and human rights risks in their operations and supply chains. Our team’s approach is multidisciplinary, combining legal expertise, environmental science, and social research. This provides businesses with a clear understanding of the challenges they face and the opportunities available to them.

Our services extend beyond just assessments. We offer strategic advice on environmental assessments, human rights risk assessments, mitigation strategies, and compliance support. We also provide due diligence reporting, sustainability audits, stakeholder engagement, and training modules centered on environmental best practices and human rights awareness. Our goal is to work closely with our clients, helping them develop plans that reduce risks, improve compliance, and establish them as leaders in their respective industries.

At the heart of our services is a commitment to practicality, transparency, and sustainability. We believe in offering solutions that drive business growth while also contributing positively to the world. Environmental and human rights due diligence is an essential aspect of modern business, and we’re here to make that process as seamless as possible.
