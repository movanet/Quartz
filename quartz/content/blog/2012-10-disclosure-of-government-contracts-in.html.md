###  Disclosure of Government Contracts in Indonesia 

Thursday, October 18, 2012  [ Movanet ](https://www.blogger.com/profile/10356608562678830076 "author profile")

A paper titled “[Perjanjian Badan Publik Dengan Pihak Ketiga: Anotasi Pasal 11 ayat (1) (e) Undang Undang Nomor 14 Tahun 2008](http://blog.alafghani.info/2012/10/perjanjian-badan-publik-dengan-pihak_3669.html)” is available for download (only in Bahasa Indonesia). The paper annotates Article 11 (1) (e) of the Indonesian Freedom of Information Law which mandates the transparency of contract. Nevertheless, the paper conclude that Article 11 (1) e does not clearly mandates “active disclosure”. The article also discusses the problem of breach of contract which may arise due to a Public Body’s compliance with a disclosure request made under the FoI Law. 

English version of the article will be available soon.
