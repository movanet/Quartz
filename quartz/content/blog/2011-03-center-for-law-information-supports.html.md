A group of world Non Governmental Organizations, including the Center for Law Information (CeLI), petition for the establishment of a [Special Procedure](http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/special/index.htm) on climate change and human rights. The NGOs consider that establishment of a special procedure, such as that which provide a mandate to a special rapporteur, would be an efficient way to tackle the issue.  
  


A letter was sent to diplomatic missions in Geneva urging them to "**publicly call for the creation of a Special Procedure****on climate change and human rights who reports to the Human Rights Council in a resolution to be adopted at the 17th Regular Session of the Human Rights Council in June 2011."
