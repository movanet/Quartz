The UNESCO Centre for Water Law, Policy and Science, University of Dundee will organize a workshop on "Integrated Water Resources Management for Law and Policy makers/advisers" this June, 2015. According to the [website](http://www.dundee.ac.uk/water/events/details/an-introduction-to-integrated-catchment-management-for-law-and-policy-makers.php):  
  


> The course aims to provide participants with critical insights into the science that underpins integrated catchment management, through an exploration of key hydrological, ecological and hydrogeological processes, methodologies and the current state of the art. A further theme of the short-course will be to explore how the accessibility of water-related scientific data and information can be enhanced within a policy/decision-making context. This intensive short-course is targeted at water professionals that do not have a scientific background, such as lawyers and policy-makers.
