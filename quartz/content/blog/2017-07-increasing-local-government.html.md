###  Increasing local government responsibility for communal scale sanitation 

Wednesday, July 5, 2017  [ Unknown ](https://www.blogger.com/profile/00655928445009738553 "author profile")

CRPG and the Institute for Sustainable Futures, University of Technology Sydney recently completed the research project "Increasing local government responsibility for communal scale sanitation" under the support of the Indonesia Infrastructure Initiative. The INDII project is a follow up of our previously completed [ADRAS project](http://communitysanitationgovernance.info/research-outputs/) on community based wastewater. This project was also tightly related to our previous [AIIRA project on Community Based Water Services](https://crpg.info/41-aiira).

  
The project report consist of two parts and both can be downloaded from INDII's website (contact us if you have difficulties in accessing the reports).  
  
Part 1: [Review of national program guidelines and two city case studies](http://www.indii.co.id/images/dx_publication_file/11446/lg-responsibilitycommunalscalesanitationpart-1.pdf) ([website](http://www.indii.co.id/index.php/en/publications/increasing-local-government-responsibility-for-communal-scale-sanitation-part-1-review-of-national-program-guidelines-and-two-city-case-studies))
