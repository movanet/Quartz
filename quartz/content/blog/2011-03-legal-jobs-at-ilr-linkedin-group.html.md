Linkedin opened up its job feature:

> _LinkedIn has made some upgrades to the Jobs section of LinkedIn groups that will make it much easier for group members and group managers to share LinkedIn jobs specifically tailored to your group. Group owners and managers can set up a keyword based feed of LinkedIn jobs into the group. Group members can also share relevant jobs into the group.  
>    
> Organic postings from the old Groups "Jobs" tab are now in the Career discussions section. _
> 
>   
> _We are excited about these changes. Be sure to visit the jobs section of your group and set up a targeted jobs feed for your group today._
> 
> __
> 
> _Best Regards,  
>    
> The LinkedIn Team_

  
And so, the ILR Linkedin Group used this opportunity for its members to broadcast their talent-hunt. [**Join the ILR Linked Group here**](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&gid=3397195), and start posting your firm’s job offers.
