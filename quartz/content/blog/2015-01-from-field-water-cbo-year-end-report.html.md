###  From the field: Water CBO Year End Report 

Sunday, January 18, 2015  [ Unknown ](https://www.blogger.com/profile/00655928445009738553 "author profile")

Here's a year-end presentation (_in Bahasa Indonesia_) that we obtained from a local Community Based Water and Sanitation Organization, HIPPAMS Tirto Agung, Tlanak Village, Lamongan Regency in East Java. The CBO is one of the best in East Java. The reporting, administrative and financial system is quite modern. They are equipped with accounting software. They have also implemented a progressive tariff. Obviously, there are challenges and rooms for improvement that we will highlight in our final report, but this is probably one of the best model of water CBO currently in existence.
