Thursday, September 16, 2010  [ Movanet ](https://www.blogger.com/profile/10356608562678830076 "author profile")

Just to add some more tips:

1\. Don’t forget to bring converters!

2\. Use Kindle to read (and skip all the print papers)

3\. Make sure everything is fully charged

4\. Hassle first, fun later. Meaning: go through security check then find your coffee
