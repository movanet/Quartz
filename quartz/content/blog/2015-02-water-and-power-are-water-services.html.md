###  Water and Power, are water services still public? 

Friday, February 6, 2015  [ Unknown ](https://www.blogger.com/profile/00655928445009738553 "author profile")

Municipal Services Project (MSP) have put a nice video for understanding the idea of 'corporatisation' and its implication on 'publicness'. Have a look also at an article by David McDonald "What is corporatization? The ‘new’ look of water and power utilities" at the [MSP Blog](http://www.municipalservicesproject.org/blog/what-corporatization-%E2%80%98new%E2%80%99-look-water-and-power-utilities).
