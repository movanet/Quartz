###  Soft Law for Nanotechnology 

Sunday, December 28, 2014  [ Unknown ](https://www.blogger.com/profile/00655928445009738553 "author profile")

New [article](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13669877.2014.889200) from Prof Gary Marchant. Here's a snippet of the abstract:

"This article suggests two potential drivers to increase participation in voluntary risk management programs for nanomaterials: liability and insurance. Given the lack of regulation and public concerns about nanotechnology, personal injury, and other product liability litigation is highly likely. Companies subject to such lawsuits will be able to help defend the reasonableness of their actions by pointing to their participation in voluntary risk management programs, while companies that declined to participate will be more vulnerable to liability for failing to take reasonable precautions."
