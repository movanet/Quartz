###  UN Watercourses Convention Symposium - Call for Papers 

Friday, December 23, 2011  [ Movanet ](https://draft.blogger.com/profile/10356608562678830076 "author profile")

UNWC Global Initiative Symposium  
  
Co-organised by IHP-HELP Centre for Water Law, Policy & Science (under  
the auspices of UNESCO), University of Dundee and WWF  
  
The 1997 UN Watercourses Convention – What Relevance in the 21st  
Century?  
  
5th-8th June 2012, University of Dundee, Scotland, UK  
  
Call for Papers  
  
In 1994 the UN General Assembly made the decision to elaborate a global  
framework instrument on the law of the non-navigational uses of  
international watercourses (UN General Assembly Resolution 49/52). The  
resultant Convention was adopted in 1997 by more than 100 nations. Since  
the Convention's adoption over 14 years ago, there has been a  
heightened recognition of the numerous challenges humanity faces in  
securing water for all, and a widespread acceptance that governance  
plays a key role. However, the legal architecture for international  
watercourses remains fragmented, and the UNWC has not yet entered into  
force.  
  
In recent years, a coalition of institutions under the general rubric  
of the UNWC Global Initiative has come together to examine the  
underlying reasons why the UNWC has not yet entered into force.  
Additionally, the UNWC Global Initiative has sought to further knowledge  
and understanding of the relevance of the UNWC in addressing the  
contemporary pressures on the world's freshwater resources. As part of  
the activities of the UNWC Global Initiative, the IHP-HELP Centre for  
Water Law, Policy & Science in collaboration with WWF will be organising  
a global symposium on the UNWC between 5th and 8th of June 2011. The  
aim of the symposium is to gather together a wide and diverse range of  
experts from academia, government, international organisations, civil  
society, etc, to debate the existing and potential relevance of this  
global framework instrument.  
  
Towards this endeavour the convenors of the symposium are inviting  
experts to submit papers on a range of topics related to the UNWC.
