###  Anti-Privatisation Debates, Opaque Rules and ‘Privatised’ Water Services Provision: Some Lessons from Indonesia 

Monday, February 15, 2016  [ Unknown ](https://www.blogger.com/profile/00655928445009738553 "author profile")

This was from a conference in IDS, Sussex, back in 2011, published in the [IDS Bulletin in 2012](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1759-5436.2012.00303.x/abstract). I found out that Wiley (the publisher) and IDS has opened access to this paper.
