The [2010 OECD Investment Policy Review](http://www.oecd.org/document/26/0,3343,en_2649_34893_46225306_1_1_1_1,00.html) contains a quite comprehensive assessment of Indonesia’s regulatory and investment policy. For those of you who areinvestment lawyers, Chapter 2 discusses in depth, Indonesia’s implementation of international investment principles. Other aspects such as competition policy, infrastructure, and corporate governance were also addressed. A sneak peak of the book is [available in Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=0FrTXwShFkMC&pg=PA147&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false) . The book dedicate a sub chapter on water infrastructure (ch 5.6) and cited my newspaper Article ([Indonesia Needs a Strong Water Services Law](http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/08/31/indonesia-needs-a-strong-water-services-law.html)). The analysis on water related investment is not really in depth, but it agrees that vague laws and regulations could be a deterring factor for foreign investment in this sector. The book’s executive summary is available for a [free download](http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/17/14/46307173.pdf), but the complete hard and soft copy versions are not free.
