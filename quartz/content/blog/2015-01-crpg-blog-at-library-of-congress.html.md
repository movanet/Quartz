###  CRPG blog at the Library of Congress Webarchive 

Wednesday, January 28, 2015  [ Unknown ](https://www.blogger.com/profile/00655928445009738553 "author profile")

Back in 2010, we [informed](http://blog.crpg.info/2010/09/indonesia-law-report-to-be-archived-by.html) that our blog (back then it was called Indonesia Law Report or ILR) was to be archived by the Library of Congress:

> The United States Library of Congress has selected your website for inclusion in the historic collection of Internet materials related to Legal Blawgs. The Library of Congress preserves the Nation's cultural artifacts and provides enduring access to them. The Library's traditional functions, acquiring, cataloging, preserving and serving collection materials of historical importance to the Congress and the American people to foster education and scholarship, extend to digital materials, including websites. 
> 
>   
> 
> 
> With your permission, the Library of Congress or its agent will engage in the collection of content from your website at regular intervals over time and make this collection available to researchers both at Library facilities and, by special arrangement, to scholarly research institutions. In addition, the Library hopes that you share its vision of preserving Internet materials and permitting researchers from across the world to access them. Our Web Archives are important because they contribute to the historical record, capturing information that could otherwise be lost. With the growing role of the Web as an influential medium, records of historic events could be considered incomplete without materials that were "born digital" and never printed on paper.

Now, you can browse the archives at the Library of Congress [_**here**_](http://webarchive.loc.gov/lcwa0015/*/http://indolaw.alafghani.info/). The archives are available from 2007 to 2012. The CRPG blog is honored to be archived by the LOC and contribute to historical record!
