###  About Open Government Partnership and Independent Reporting Mechanism 

Thursday, February 18, 2016  [ Unknown ](https://www.blogger.com/profile/12321041940010171940 "author profile")

**Background**

Corruption is one of the most serious problem that Indonesia currently have. To fight corruption, do citizen empowerment, and strengthening the governance is important to create a better country, to make a better life for all of the citizen. In order to achieve that, since 2011 Indonesia government partnered with Open Government Partnership (OGP), a voluntary international initiative that aims to secure commitments from governments to their citizenry to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance.

  


**OGP Process**

Indonesia as countries participating in OGP has to follow a process for consultation during the development of their action plan, and during implementation. 

In this 2014-2015 period, Indonesia has reached its third national plan, where the scope has been expanded. There was even called SOLUSIMU, a contest where citizens could submit their ideas for improving public services for inclusion in the Action Plan, to make the betterment on the exclusivity-hole from the previous process on the previous period. However, the lack of advance notice, lack of evidence of consultation events, and lack of clarity on the incorporation of citizen-generated ideas in the action plan undermined the government’s increased public participation efforts.

Core Team meetings served as the multi-stakeholder consultation forum. It is found that there still was very little meaningful consultation and collaboration between government and wider civil society on the commitment implementation. The Core Team meetings then focused on raising awareness of the OGP process, and increasing public participation especially through SOLUSIMU contest, but the team did not publicize or track progress on commitments.

  


**Methodological note**

In Indonesia, The Independent Reporting Mechanism of OGP has partnered with Mohammad Mova Al’Afghani of Centre for Regulation, Policy, and Governance (CRPG), that carried out the evaluation of the development and implementation of this Indonesia’s third action plan. CRPG reviewed the government’s self-assesment report, gathered the views of civil society, and interviewed related government officials and stakeholders. After that, OGP staff and a panel of experts reviewed the report.

CPRG reviewed three key documents prepared by the government: a report on [Indonesia’s third action plan](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/default/files/Indonesia%20OGP%20ACTION%20PLAN%202014-2015_0.pdf) submitted to the OGP portal in 2014, the internal document detailing action plan commitments and milestones published in Bahasa Indonesian in April 2015, and the government self-assessment report (GSAR) published in April 2015.

A stakeholder forum in FGD model was organized in Jakarta by The IRM researcher and Medialink, a civil society organization (CSO), in order to gather the opinion of multiple stakeholders.

**Report Coverage**

This report covers the first year of implementation of Indonesia’s third action plan, 7 November 2014 through 31 July 2015. Beginning in 2015, the IRM also publishes end of term reports to account for the final status of progress at the end of the action plan’s two-year period. This report follows on two earlier reviews of OGP performance, “Indonesia Progress Report 2011-2013” and “Indonesia Special Accountability Report 2013.” These reports covered the development and implementation of the first action plan as well as the development and implementation of the second action plan from 1 January 2013 through 31 December 2013.
