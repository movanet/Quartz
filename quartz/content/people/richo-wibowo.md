### Expertise and Research Interest: Administrative Law, Good Governance, Procurement, Comparative Law, Corruption

Richo obtained his Bachelor of Laws (S.H) from Faculty of Law, Universitas Islam Indonesia in 2006. He then served as a public defender at Legal Aid and Consultation Institute under that University. A year later, he got a scholarship from the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology to study Master of Laws (LL.M) program at Utrecht University.

Since 2008, Richo has been working as a lecturer at Administrative Law Department, Faculty of Law, Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM). His teaching subjects are Administrative Law, Law and Public Policy, and the Oversight of the Executive Power.

From 2012 to this moment, Richo has been pursuing his Ph.D. research at the Institute of Constitutional Law, Administrative Law, and Legal Theory, Utrecht University. This research is financially supported by the Directorate General of Higher Education, Universitas Gadjah Mada, and Utrecht University.

The theme of his Ph.D. is about reducing bureau-pathology on public procurement in Indonesia from two perspectives: selected principles of good governance (transparency, equality, and accountability) and comparative public procurement laws of the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Having regard that public contract is an intertwined issue; although his research focuses on administrative law, the research also discusses the issue of business (competition) law and criminal (anti-corruption) law.

Richo has been involved in various teams for conducting research activities or delivering legal advice to, inter alia, Ministry of Public Works, Jogjakarta Province, GIZ, GTZ â€“ Swiss Contact. Some of his thoughts can be found in chapters in books, journals, or opinions in the newspapers.
