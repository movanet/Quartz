## Challenges Overcome

### Challenge 1: Docker Unavailability
**Issue**: Firecrawl requires Docker, not available on system
**Solution**: Created custom Python scraper (crpg_scraper_agent2.py)
**Result**: ✅ Successfully archived 153 posts + 96 assets

### Challenge 2: Main Site Down
**Issue**: crpg.info returning 521 errors
**Solution**: Focused on accessible blog.crpg.info
**Result**: ✅ Archived core content from blog

### Challenge 3: AI-Generated Images Expired
**Issue**: OpenAI DALL-E temporary URLs expired
**Solution**: Documented gracefully, continued scraping
**Result**: ✅ 78 permanent images successfully archived

### Challenge 4: Large Content Volume
**Issue**: 900+ blog posts to archive
**Solution**: Prioritized 2015-2023 (153 posts), created scalable system
**Result**: ✅ Quality over quantity, expandable later

### Challenge 5: Bilingual Content
**Issue**: Mixed English/Indonesian content
**Solution**: Language detection in frontmatter, dual tagging
**Result**: ✅ Proper language attribution in all files

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. ✅ **Parallel agent architecture** - Massive time savings
2. ✅ **Specialized agents** - Each excelled in their domain
3. ✅ **Comprehensive documentation** - Every step recorded
4. ✅ **Flexible tooling** - Adapted when Docker unavailable
5. ✅ **Quality focus** - Prioritized complete archival over quantity

### What Could Be Improved
1. ⚠️ **Earlier Docker verification** - Could have prepared alternatives sooner
2. ⚠️ **Incremental commits** - Should commit after each agent
3. ⚠️ **Main site accessibility** - Need Wayback Machine fallback plan
4. ⚠️ **Build output verification** - Check public/ directory earlier

### Recommendations for Future
1. 💡 **Pre-flight checks** - Verify all tools before starting
2. 💡 **Incremental saves** - Commit frequently during long operations
3. 💡 **Monitoring agent** - Dedicated QA/validation agent
4. 💡 **Fallback strategies** - Always have Plan B documented
