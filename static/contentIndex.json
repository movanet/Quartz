The culprit blamed for the incident is abrasion from salt water (news in Bahasa Indonesia):\nEarlier on the 14th of September, another land subsidence occurred along Manggarai river in Sultan Agung street, causing the fence to tilt for 45 degrees (click here for more news).\n\nBelow is a video from ABCNews (2008) about the sinking of Jakarta. Main cause of the floods are solid wastes and squatters in riversides. Both causes the river to become shallow and narrow, thereby reducing its capacity during high flow. High-rise building and over-abstraction of groundwater also contribute to land subsidence and saltwater intrusion.\nRelated posts:\n\nLegal Policy and Development.

Yes. But look also at its elucidation.\n\nIf there is anything I forgot to upload into this website from the last World Water Week then it is my own presentation and pictures. So here it is. The title of my presentation is the above headline. I argue that the Human Right to Water may be able to correct structural loopholes in the current legal framework for water resources management in Indonesia. There are, however, prerequisites which must be fulfilled for such role to take place, and these are (i) building linkages between the Human Right to Water into the current judicial and legislative system and (ii) developing existing institutions, in terms of capacity, resources and mandate in order to incorporate human rights claims.\nI have a draft paper to support my arguments which I decide not to share as it is still in the form of, well, a draft paper.

The current version of the draft law in its preamble does not seem to provide enough justification on why accounting services has to be regulated. It only states that at present, there is not enough regulation on the profession and that more rules are required to provide ‘legal certainty’ for clients and public accountants.\nThe academic draft does contain some justifications on why the accounting industry needs to be regulated, among other, that the profession attempts to reduce information asymmetry between principal and agents of an undertaking and provide them with financial information to back up their business decision. However, this is not adequately enshrined in the draft Law.\nILR’s sources at the House of Representative commented that the real aim of the draft law is to curtail the ever expanding growth of foreign accounting firms and provide opportunity for local firms to grow. Provisions regulating foreign accounting firms (Articles 17 and 13 of the current Draft) will become a contentious subject to be debated. On these articles, the number of foreign partners and foreign workers in an accounting firm is limited.\n_ILR will closely monitor the Draft Law on Public Accountant.

This ruling is an important breakthrough for the freedom of expression in Indonesia.\nLast January, two lawyers from the Center for Law Information, Rahmat Bagja and Fatahillah Hoed submitted a petition to the Constitutional Court demanding the Court to revoke Law No. 4 PNPS 1963 which provides the legal basis to the Attorney General to ban books.\nThe lawyers successfully pleaded their case before the Constitutional Court. The Court decided in Wednesday that Law No. 4 PNPS 1963 was invalidated. In the future, banning of books will have to be conducted through a court proceeding.\nIndonesia is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and has therefore, the international obligation to protect the freedom of expression. In the past, book banning has been used by the New Order authoritarian regime to tackle political dissents.\nJakarta, October 14th, 2010\nCenter for Law Information (CeLI)\nIndonesia Law Report (ILR)\n\nPicture: Mr Rahmat Bagja and Mr. Fatahillah Hoed at the Constitutional Court’s Judicial Review of Law No. 4 PNPS 1963\n Posted by: Movanet \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2010-11-foreign-direct-investment-in-indonesia.html":{"slug":"blog/2010-11-foreign-direct-investment-in-indonesia.html","filePath":"blog/2010-11-foreign-direct-investment-in-indonesia.html.md","title":"Foreign Direct Investment in Indonesia [Guest Post] | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":["mailto:suria@surialaw.com"],"tags":["corporate-»","investment-»"],"content":"corporate », investment »\nForeign Direct Investment in Indonesia [Guest Post]\nMonday, November 8, 2010   Movanet \n_Ed note: this is a guest post by Suria Nataadmadja (suria[at]surialaw.com) and Selviyani from _SURIA NATAADMADJA &amp; ASSOCIATES . If you have further inquiry on this topic, please contact the authors directly.\n__\nAs a matter of clarity, the term foreign direct investment is used here to distinguish it from the investment made by acquiring the shares of an Indonesian company from the stock market. Foreign direct investment can also be done by acquiring the shares of an established foreign investment company. The effect of foreign direct investment is to ascertain the share holding of foreign investors in a limited liability company as regulated by Law Number 40 of 2007 regarding Limited Liability Company , promulgated on August 16, 2007 in State Gazette 2007 Number 106 (“Law 40/2007”), and Supplement to State Gazette Number 4756.\nForeign direct investment in Indonesia has started as early as 1967 and the government has changed the law to Law Number 25 of 2007 regarding Investment, promulgated on April 26, 2007 in State Gazette 2007 Number 67, and Supplement to State Gazette Number 4724 (“Law 25/2007”). This Law supersedes Law No.1 of 1967 regarding _Foreign Investment,_and Law No.6 of 1968 regarding Domestic Investment. Compared to the 1967 Law, the new legislation is more accommodating to foreign investors, addressing important issues such as land rights. A presidential decree number 36 of 2010 regarding List of Business Open and Closed with Restriction for Investment(“Negative Investment List”) updated Indonesia’s Negative Investment List of December 2007 as regulated by presidential decree Number 76 of 2007. The main purpose of the new Negative Investment List are to implement the Indonesian government’s commitment to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations/ASEAN Economic Community but nevertheless it will encourage foreign direct investments from other countries as well. Only direct investments either foreign or domestic will be affected by the Negative Investment List. Indirect investment through the stock market will be exempted from complying with this Negative Investment List.\nCertain investment that is meeting the requirement as stipulated in article 18 of Law 25/2007, entitled to be given tax incentives i.e. Income tax reduction; Custom exemption to machineries, capital goods and tools; Custom exemption on raw materials; VAT exemption; Accelerated amortization and depreciation; and Incentive on land and building tax. The government also recently issued Government Regulations No.1 of 2007 regarding the Facility of Income Tax for Investment on Certain Business Sectors or Regions(January 2, 2007). The certain business sectors amongst others are: food processing industries, packaging industries, plastic goods industries, cement industries, furniture industries, seafood processing industries, etc. Furthermore, the Government also issued the following regulations e.g. Ministry of Finance No.16/PML/03/2007 regarding Granting Income Tax Facilities for Investment on Certain Business Sectors or Certain Regions , Directorate General of Tax No. Per 67/PJ/07 of 2007 regarding Procedure of Granting Income Tax for Investment on Certain Business Sectors and/or Certain Regions.\nInvestments in Indonesia are coordinated by the Investment Coordination Board or Badan Koordinasi Penanaman Modal (“BKPM”); a __ nongovernmental department board leads by Head of BKPM, a position of ministerial level. BKPM’s policy has a very simple guidelines, forms, and requirements for filling applications of investment licenses as regulated by Decree of Head of BKPM Number 57/SK/2004 and Number 70/SK/2004. Latest regulation issued by BKPM is regulation No. 12 of 2009 regarding Guidelines and Procedures Application of December 23, 2009, that replaced the previous BKPM regulations on the guidelines and procedures for investment applications under domestic and foreign Investments. The latest regulation is sufficiently clear and self explanatory whereas it is attached with the necessary forms and guidance which are provided in Indonesian and English.\nIn practice, the process from the application to BKPM approval will take approximately between 3 weeks to 3 months. The most time consuming process is to translate foreign company documents to English, the language accepted by BKPM, and communicating Indonesian regulations to the foreign investors.\nThe approval from BKPM shall be followed by limited liability company establishment which for the foreign investment company shall be in form of a limited liability company under the foreign investment scheme (usually called “PT. PMA”). PT. PMA shall be formed by at least two share holders in form of a civil law notary’s deed (paragraph 1 article 7 Law 40/2007 ). Then, the deed shall obtain a statutory body status from the Minister of Law and Human Rights (paragraph 4 article 7 Law 40/2007 ) and published at the Supplement to State Gazette (article 30 Law 40/2007).\nAlthough BKPM has been designed to be a “one stop services” institution, as regulated by a presidential decree Number 27 of 2009, which has given BKPM the authority to issue investment licenses, however, major specific licenses e.g. For Mining and oil and gas, plantation and forestry sectors still have to obtain licenses from other government related authorities. Certain permits will also be applied through the local government authorities e.g. Tax and related land permits and recommendations, etc.\nSuria Nataadmadja, Partner\nSelviyani, Associate\nSURIA NATAADMADJA &amp; ASSOCIATES\nwww.surialaw.com\n Posted by: Movanet \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2010-12-fwd-your-paper-makes-ssrn-top-ten-list.html":{"slug":"blog/2010-12-fwd-your-paper-makes-ssrn-top-ten-list.html","filePath":"blog/2010-12-fwd-your-paper-makes-ssrn-top-ten-list.html.md","title":"Fwd: Your Paper Makes SSRN Top Ten List | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Fwd: Your Paper Makes SSRN Top Ten List\nTuesday, December 28, 2010   Movanet \nNote: this is a working paper.

The title of the paper is “The Potential Role of the Human Right to Water in the Management of Indonesia’s Water Resources”. In the paper, I argued that:\n“… there are gaps in the Indonesian legal framework in securing transparency, access to information, participation, access to justice and the procedure in recognizing customary rights in water resources management. Without adequate access to these procedural rights, vulnerable, marginalized and financially weaker groups will be left out from water resources management and will not be able to secure their entitlements. The Human Right to Water has potentials for filling such gap by reforming the implementing regulation of the Water Resources Law and enhancing the possibility to obtain legal recourse ”.\nColleague Hugo Tremblay reviewed this paper in his blog and commented “ Reading the paper, it sometimes feels like the human right to water is constituted of a bundle of ‘substantive’ and ‘procedural’ rights (ex: see p.4 last §, as well as subsection 5.b on Right(s) to participation, transparency and access to information). Are these rights constituent human rights included under a human right to water? Are they considered as autonomous human rights? Is this an illustration of the doctrine of indivisible, inter-related and inter-dependent human rights?”\nWhile the right to receive and impart information is recognized as a form human rights (Article 19 of the UDHR), the conflation of this right into ‘Freedom of Information’ has sometimes been contested. Although many argued that freedom of information is a human rights (see for example, this article from Toby Mendel), some skeptic may argue that the original intent of Article 19 of the UDHR is to protect free speech and not to provide specific access to governmental information.\nFurthermore, the concepts of transparency, participation and access to justice is often mingled with ‘good governance’. A presentation from Susanne Schmidt of the UNDP asked a question: “Is IWRM an HRBA?” The present state of research appears to acknowledge that the two are ‘mutually reinforcing’ with the latter (HRBA) focusing on the equity aspect of governance. A joint working paper of several organisations even consider HRBA as a specific kind of ‘governance’.\nI acknowledge that the concept of HRBA still needs further clarification. That, I will not deal in this post. I will reserve it for another day :)\n**Related Posts:\n**Links to presentation on the Human Right to Water\nHuman Right to Water vs Integrated Water Resources Management?\n Posted by: Movanet \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2010-12-indonesia-investment-policy-review-oecd.html":{"slug":"blog/2010-12-indonesia-investment-policy-review-oecd.html","filePath":"blog/2010-12-indonesia-investment-policy-review-oecd.html.md","title":"Indonesia - Investment Policy Review – OECD | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":[],"tags":["indonesia-»","infrastructure-»","investment-»","water-»"],"content":"indonesia », infrastructure », investment », water »\nIndonesia - Investment Policy Review – OECD\nWednesday, December 22, 2010   Movanet \n\nThe 2010 OECD Investment Policy Review contains a quite comprehensive assessment of Indonesia’s regulatory and investment policy. For those of you who areinvestment lawyers, Chapter 2 discusses in depth, Indonesia’s implementation of international investment principles. Other aspects such as competition policy, infrastructure, and corporate governance were also addressed. A sneak peak of the book is available in Google Books . The book dedicate a sub chapter on water infrastructure (ch 5.6) and cited my newspaper Article (Indonesia Needs a Strong Water Services Law). The analysis on water related investment is not really in depth, but it agrees that vague laws and regulations could be a deterring factor for foreign investment in this sector.

The booklet elaborate precautionary approaches that a business organization may employ in order to prevent the leak of confidential business information.\nOne of the legal method to prevent leaks (this is not explained in the booklet) is through the signing of employee confidentiality agreement. My research however indicates that the power of confidentiality agreements differs across jurisdiction. In the common law jurisdiction, confidentiality carries more weight due to the operation of obligation of confidence under the English equity law. The obligation of confidence protect the imparting of information in a ‘trust’ environment, such as between a doctor and its patient, or between a employer and employee. As such, the obligation may be enforced irrespective of agreement.\nThis is not the situation in continental legal system. I have yet to find any obligation to keep secret, independently of an agreement. Hence, an employee signing confidentiality agreement in a continental jurisdiction will be bound only to the extent of the agreement. When he decide to disclose the information one day, it would amount simply to a breach of (an employment) contract.\nDetermination of access level and the use of Digital Rights Management are therefore the most appropriate precaution. You will find some details about this in the booklet.\n Posted by: Movanet \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2010-12-transparency-fighters-and-rejection-of.html":{"slug":"blog/2010-12-transparency-fighters-and-rejection-of.html","filePath":"blog/2010-12-transparency-fighters-and-rejection-of.html.md","title":"Transparency fighters and the rejection of authority | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":[],"tags":["information-»","internet-»","transparency-»"],"content":"information », internet », transparency »\nTransparency fighters and the rejection of authority\nMonday, December 20, 2010   Movanet \n\nWhat do whistleblowers, transparency fighters, file sharing activists and defectors have in common? They may all possess the same personality trait: a rejection of authority. According to Esther Dyson in project syndicate:\n\nBut you probably need to be a bit weird and callous to devote your life to transparency for others. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the imprisoned ex-CEO of what was Russia’s largest oil company, is another example of a flawed, uncompromising person who challenged the flawed people in power and their unaccountability. Such people do not die for our sins; Rather, they sin on our behalf, so that we may live comfortably while they afflict the authorities at great personal risk and in disregard of (authorities’ interpretation of) the law and sometimes even ethics.\n\nInformation is always used to impose and safeguard an established authority. Because knowledge is power, only the priest are allowed to read the scriptures. This is evident in the ancient Mayan civilization who restricts the ability of reading and writing into a small circle of elite class. The spread of the printing press in the European history allows the Bible to be studied by commoners and along with Luther’s writings, paves the way to protestanism , ending the Catholic church monopoly to human salvation in the Christian world.\nWithin the psyche of these leakers – whistleblowers, journalists, spies— whatever you wish to call them, is the hidden desire to achieve some sort of equilibrium and a resentment to authority. These people are anarchists.\n Posted by: Movanet \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2010-12-transparency-leads-to-blackmail.html":{"slug":"blog/2010-12-transparency-leads-to-blackmail.html","filePath":"blog/2010-12-transparency-leads-to-blackmail.html.md","title":"2010-12-transparency-leads-to-blackmail.html","links":[],"tags":["accounting-»","information-»","transparency-»"],"content":"accounting », information », transparency »\nTransparency leads to blackmail?\nWednesday, December 15, 2010   Movanet \nThe Jakarta Post reported several months ago, that the State Audit agency (BPK) cease the publication of companies financial audit report due to blackmailing concerns. According to the article:\n\n\nThe Supreme Audit Agency (BPK) has stopped publishing online reports, to the dismay of freedom of information proponents. The agency said the state institutions it audited had complained that it was “too open”. BPK provided reports through the Internet even before the 2008 Law on Freedom of Information was implemented this year.\n….\nBut reports of blackmail prompted the agency to close the online access, requiring information seekers to submit official letters to obtain a hard copy of reports. A public relations staffer of BPK, who requested anonymity, said, “The state institutions have been complaining that we were too open.” “[The institutions] said the reports had been used to blackmail them,” the source said recently.\n\nWhy fear blackmail if you are right? One of the possible reason is the corruption witch-hunt. The eradication of corruption in Indonesia is somewhat turning into a witch-hunt (a colleague in the UK is researching this for his Ph.D in Anthropology). Dealing with KPK and the Prossecutor office is cumbersome. This provides a disincentive for being transparent.\nHow do we handle this? Well, we need to provide more incentive for being more transparent. Transparency should not be used only for displaying the rotten apples of an organization, but also in highlighting the hidden jewels. This is what expert called a ‘targetted transparency’, which are conducted through, among other, publication of performance target benchmarked against certain a set of indicators.\nImg source:mediaindonesia.com\n Posted by: Movanet \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2011-01-fw-tax-laws-in-some-countries-do-not.html":{"slug":"blog/2011-01-fw-tax-laws-in-some-countries-do-not.html","filePath":"blog/2011-01-fw-tax-laws-in-some-countries-do-not.html.md","title":"Fw: Tax: Laws in some countries do not meet global standards | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":["mailto:Sara.SREBERNY-MOHAMMADI@oecd.org","mailto:jeffrey.owens@oecd.org","mailto:pascal.saint-amans@oecd.org"],"tags":[],"content":"Fw: Tax: Laws in some countries do not meet global standards\nThursday, January 27, 2011   Movanet \nSent from my BlackBerry® smartphone\n\nFrom: Sara.SREBERNY-MOHAMMADI@oecd.org\nDate: Thu, 27 Jan 2011 19:10:40 +0100\nSubject: Tax: Laws in some countries do not meet global standards\nOECD – Paris, 27 January 2011\nTax: Laws in some countries do not meet global standards ****\nThe Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax purposes, hosted by the OECD, has released ten reports which evaluate jurisdictions’ commitment to tax transparency and examine whether information is made available and accessible to foreign tax authorities. These reports follow eight others released in September 2010.\nThe Global Forum has been mandated by the G-20 to assist specific jurisdictions, as well as the international community, to assess the status of national tax legislation, examine whether the laws are enforced, and make recommendations for improvement.\nFor five jurisdictions the Global Forum is releasing Phase 1 reports which assess the legal and regulatory framework of the jurisdictions. The other five combine Phase 1 and Phase 2 reviews assessing both the legal framework and the practical implementation of the standard.\n** Phase 1 reviews**\nFour jurisdictions, Barbados, the Seychelles, San Marino and Trinidad and Tobago fall short of the international standard and will need to implement the recommendations made in their reports before moving to the next phase of their evaluations. It has been noted in the case of San Marino that important legislation has recently been passed (see annex 1 of the report) and will further be examined by the Global Forum.\nThe report on **Guernsey **shows that a satisfactory legal framework is in place but that there are minor issues that Guernsey has been asked to address.\n** Combined reviews**\n\nMauritius underwent a combined review which showed that there are missing elements in the legal framework such as accounting information on some of the offshore companies. The assessment of the practice in Mauritius shows that there is room for improvement, in particular as regards the access to bank information by the tax authorities.\nThe four other “combined” reviews show that the systems in place in Australia, Denmark, Ireland and Norway have achieved effective exchange of information in practice. However, there are some minor issues related to information on bearer shares or nominees which will have to be addressed.\nMore than 60 reports will be completed by year end.\nContacts: Jeffrey Owens, Director, Centre for Tax Policy and Administration at +33 1 45 24 91 08 or jeffrey.owens@oecd.org / Pascal Saint-Amans, Head of the Global Secretariat at + 33 1 45 24 97 46 or pascal.saint-amans@oecd.org\nInformation on the work of the Global forum is available in the background information brief.\nMore information on the Global Forum is available at www.oecd.org/tax/transparency\nThe reports at a glance\n** Phase 1 Reviews: Legal and Regulatory Framework**\nBarbados: Some deficiencies have been identified in Barbados bilateral treaties and Barbados has not yet signed new agreements with all jurisdictions wishing to do so. The implementation of recommendations made in the report to address these and other matters will be reviewed in the next 12 months, and only then Barbados will be considered for moving onto the next phase of the evaluation.\nGuernsey: The review of Guernsey showed that its legal and regulatory framework is largely in place to ensure effective exchange of information, notably sound access powers and an expanding network of bilateral agreements. Improvements to some accounting rules should nevertheless be made. The evaluation of the practical implementation of this framework will take place in 2012.\nSan Marino : The peer review has identified some deficiencies in the domestic laws of San Marino, notably including limitations in the authorities’ powers to obtain information mainly on civil tax matters for the purpose of international cooperation. As a result it is not yet ready to move to the next stage of the evaluation. San Marino has in the recent months passed a number of laws with a view to overcome these shortcomings. Its position will therefore be reviewed.\n**Seychelles: **The review of the Seychelles showed deficiencies as regards the availability of ownership and accounting information in respect of offshore entities. In addition, powers to access information should be strengthened. Amendments to its legal and regulatory system are necessary in order for the Seychelles to qualify for the next phase of the evaluation.\n**Trinidad and Tobago: **Trinidad and Tobago is party to a number of bilateral treaties and a multilateral convention. However, it is unable to exchange information to the international standard since not all but one of these agreements has restrictions on access to information by Trinidad and Tobago’s tax authorities. The implementation of the recommendations made in the report will be reviewed in the next 12 months, before Trinidad and Tobago is considered for the next phase of the evaluation.\n** Combined reviews: Legal and regulatory framework and also the implementation of that framework in practice**\n**Australia: **Australia is exchanging information to the standard with almost 80 countries. Australia’s legal and institutional framework supports effective access to and provision of information requested by competent authorities of other jurisdictions.\n**Denmark: **Denmark is exchanging information to the standard with almost 100 countries. Denmark’s legal and institutional framework supports effective access to and provision of information requested by competent authorities of other jurisdictions.\n**Ireland: **Ireland is exchanging information to the standard with over 50 countries. Ireland’s legal and institutional framework supports effective access to and provision of information requested by competent authorities of other jurisdictions.\nMauritius : Mauritius has revised its legal and regulatory framework to give its competent authority broad access to most relevant information. However accounting information is not available in all cases and powers to obtain some information are untested. A further analysis will be undertaken in 6 months to assess whether Mauritius exchanges this information effectively and in a timely manner.\nNorway : Norway is exchanging information to the standard with more than 100 countries. Norway’s legal and institutional framework supports effective access to and provision of information requested by competent authorities of other jurisdictions.\n Posted by: Movanet \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2011-01-international-workshop-dilemmas-of.html":{"slug":"blog/2011-01-international-workshop-dilemmas-of.html","filePath":"blog/2011-01-international-workshop-dilemmas-of.html.md","title":"International workshop - Dilemmas of choice: Responsibility in nanotechnology development (deadline March 31, 2011) | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":["mailto:ciga@unipd.it","mailto:[ciga@unipd.it](mailto:ciga@unipd.it)"],"tags":[],"content":"International workshop - Dilemmas of choice: Responsibility in nanotechnology development (deadline March 31, 2011)\nMonday, January 31, 2011   Movanet \nUniversity of Padova\nCALL FOR PAPERS\nInternational workshop\nDilemmas of choice\nResponsibility in nanotechnology development\nRovigo, Italy, June 6-7, 2011 (deadline: March 31, 2011)\nMore information and download here &lt;www.ciga.unipd.it/index.php\nThe Centre for Environmental Law Decisions and Corporate Ethical Certification (CIGA) at the University of Padua and the Institute for Technology Assessment and Systems Analysis (ITAS) at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, organize an international workshop titled Dilemmas of choice. Responsibility in nanotechnology development, which is aimed at presenting and debating contributions from different disciplines on several issues concerning the relationship between nanotechnology innovation and responsibility.The workshop will be held in the Italian town of Rovigo on 6 and 7 June 2011.\nThe workshop scientific organization is supervised by an international Scientific Committee and will be composed of 4 sessions, of which two are open to abstract submission, while other two are devoted to the contribution of outstanding scholars on the topic of the workshop.\nThe two sessions open to abstract submission will focus respectively on: Session 1: topics concerning regulation and regulatory systems; and Session 2: topics regarding the role of responsibility in the management and the coordination of nanotechnology development. Abstract proposals should be sent to ciga@unipd.it mailto:[ciga@unipd.it](mailto:ciga@unipd.it) by March 31, 2011.\nIntroduction and background for the workshop\nPolicies formulation, academic research, business strategies, and civil society campaigns agree that nanotechnology development should be responsible. However, the notion of responsibility is extremely diversified in the public discourse of nanoscale technologies, shifting from specialized meanings, e.g. close to liability of industrial producers, or narrower definitions, focusing on toxicological aspects to be tested experimentally, to broader interpretations, considering issues like human rights protection, social cohesion and inclusiveness. The variety of these meanings is apparently dependent on the different normative and epistemic, even disciplinary, perspectives represented in the debate, on the heterogeneity of the social actors bearing such perspectives, and on the stage of the (nano)products life-cycle that is considered, on the plurality of technical fields that are associated with nanoscale science and technology, on the more or less .\nAlso, these different meanings suggest to commentators and operators different foci of attention and policy measures, ranging from radical appeals to precaution, to the experimentation of new procedures for rule-making, to the implementation of public understanding and/or public engagement activities, and to the development of tests, standards, and measures of exposition for humans and the environment.\nOn the one hand, the formulation and implementation of these policies are affected mostly by our capacity to conjugate what “responsible development” means for us in the future tense, i.e. with regard to the consequences of our actions onto future generations, but also with regard to the assumptions about future situations that influence our way of acting. On the other, assumption about individuals and their ties to broader social communities affect the solutions for developing nanotechnology responsibly: balancing safety and the legitimate pursue of knowledge or economic opportunities, individual freedoms and collective interests (in a stronger fashion, the “common good”), distributing costs and rewards, etc..\nGoals of the workshop and thematic sessions\nThe workshop attempts to disentangle these complex meanings of responsibility in nanotechnology development by focusing on the following topics:\nSession 1:\nResponsibility and regulation under uncertainty\nOne of the most critical issues for regulation and governance consists in how to allocate the costs and burdens of the lack of scientific knowledge in term of responsibility. The use of the term “responsibility” instead of “liability” corresponds - to the aim of this session - to acquire a global regulatory view of the way technological and scientific progress in nanotechnology will impact on the assumptions of risks both at the individual and collective choices levels (here a broad meaning of the term “risk” is intended, including ethical risks; social risks; health risks; occupational risks; environmental risks, etc.).\nOn one hand, the well known logic of “no data, no market” has already been advocated in order to support the development of precautionary measures in the different regulatory frameworks affected by nanoparticles. On the other hand, it has been noted that «without an adequate scientific framework there is no way to know what data to collect» while «progress in developing the necessary scientific knowledge often depends on having a lot of data on specific materials».\nThese ‘dilemmas of precaution’ intersect the concept of responsibility, which extends beyond the usual framework on risks and benefits and which implicitly calls for a broad normative reflection on possible technological impacts and future visions. Therefore, the uncertainty that characterizes nanotechnology seemingly requires an analysis of hopes and seduction around nano to be able to grasp the epistemic and normative challenges posed by these technologies. In order to discuss the delineated framework, this session welcomes papers that, among others, will consider the following questions: How regulation and civil liability interact in order to allocate risks and costs of innovation? Is it possible a real «coordinated approach» in circumstances of uncertainty? Confronting exposure risks evaluation at work to uncertainty challenges is the existing workers health protection regulation safe enough? Do the nanotechnology risks invoke a safer and more specific revision of the existing duties to protect health? What is the role of public authorities (e.g. US and EU agencies) and international or national agencies for standardization (e.g. ISO) that interact for developing standards of safety and sustainability as well as approaches for the maintenance of the highest level of safety in nanotechnology? How to address consumers’ safety expectationswhen an innovative product is used? Is the process of information sharing effective (that is, e.g., used in cosmetics regulation) an effective way? How are these values interrelated? How is it possible to integrate responsibility into the thinking of emerging technologies? How should responsibility be linked to technological future visions?\nSession 2\nCoordinating responsibility in nanotechnology development\nRecently, a renovated regime in tecnoscientific governance “taking seriously” technology development as a collective experiment, has been proposed to democratize technoscientific expertise, as well as to take more robust and legitimate in a situation whose characteristic features are epistemic uncertainty, normative plurality, diverging interests, and public unease.\nThe public engagement strategy advocated by this model of ‘collective experimentation’ has to cope with the dilemma of inclusion/exclusion in (participatory) decision-making and the corresponding struggle to define the boundaries of what instances, groups, knowledge, values, behaviours are relevant for the purposes of the process and to transfer the legitimacy gained by decisions from the groups and constituencies involved in the deliberative processes to the groups of the ones that have not been involved.\nThis tension between ‘insiders’ and ‘outsiders’ symmetrically applies to responsibility: Who is responsible? What is the extent of this responsibility? To whom? What are the criteria, arguments, and mechanisms tracing this boundaries and determining insiders and outsiders? What are the strategies to define and allocate tasks and duties? How do the meanings of responsibility change across product life-cycles, temporal horizons and sites of innovation? How are tasks and duties to pursue what is variably defined as ‘responsible development’, allocated? How do farther and closer temporal horizons dynamically interact? How do engagement mechanisms perform coordination? What is the influence of social representations in mutual relationships between actors participating to innovation processes?\nSubmissions, deadlines and practicalities\nPapers focusing on other emerging technological fields (e.g. Biotechnology, Bioinformatics, Energy technologies, Information technology, Material Sciences, Robotics) are welcome as they provide exemplary cases and valuable lessons for nanotechnology.

Now, a decade later, public investment has surpassed US50 billion and averages 10 billion a year. ___\nMeanwhile, an estimated 50,000 people have come together to learn, debate and strategize at the WSF in Dakar, Senegal. ETC Group brings a new report – The Big Downturn? Nanogeopolitics – to that very large discussion. Executive director Pat Mooney explains why: “An urgent topic in Dakar is the proper governance of emerging technologies and how society can best respond to threats – social, environmental, health – that new technologies may pose. Nanotechnology is a case in point, having been rolled out with virtually no government oversight or public debate.”__\n_Mooney adds, “Our first major report on nano-scale technologies,_The Big Down , made its debut at the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre eight years ago. We’ve brought The Big Downturn? to Dakar because nano commercialization and investment are increasing while the regulatory vacuum persists; nano’s risks and impact need fuller discussion.”\nETC Group’s 68-page report, available for download from www.etcgroup.org/en/node/5245, provides a current snapshot of global investment, markets, governance and control, including patenting. Though the impact of tiny tech is especially difficult to discern given the lack of an agreed-upon definition for “nano” and the absence of labeling requirements, ETC Group’s report finds:\n\nWorldwide, there are more than 2000 nanotech enterprises researching and/or manufacturing nanoparticles.\nEven while the majority of consumers remain in the dark about the existence of nano-scale ingredients in commercial products, the number of product lines far exceeds the 1500 or so that have been identified by publicly available market surveys.\nAt least 60 countries have state nanotech initiatives, including newcomers Nepal, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. The United States’ public and private sectors together spend the most money; China fields more scientists. Meanwhile, Russia has suddenly emerged as the biggest public spender.\nWhile analysts tout a whopping $224 billion nano-market, the actual market figure is drastically lower – perhaps by more than ten times.\n\nThe Big Downturn? Nanogeopolitics surveys current regulatory forays (e.g., baby-steps toward mandatory reporting requirements), standards development, public engagement schemes as well as activity by the world’s most generous awarder of nano-patents, the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office.\nThe report concludes that even though the nano-industry is nervous about its health and environmental exposure and some governments are having second thoughts about their decision to fast-track nanotech, no one is willing to retreat from a technology they’ve claimed will help end the global recession and usher in a “green economy” – and rake in trillions of dollars in revenue.\nFor more information, contact:\nin Dakar\nPat Mooney mooney@etcgroup.org cell: +1 613-240-0045\nDiana Bronson diana@etcgroup.org cell: +1 514-629-9236\nlocal cell phone: + 221 __+ 77 487 5300 __\nin the United States\nKathy Jo Wetter kjo@etcgroup.org phone: +1 919-688-7302\n-----\nFor more information about our work, please visit our website at www.etcgroup.org/\nInterested in supporting our work?

Of a particular interest is his elaboration on the conscious debate of both ‘short-term’ and ‘long-term’ nanotechnology:\n\nIn the meantime, the debate about Southern engagement with nanotechnology has forged ahead, assuming common understandings about what nanotechnology is and what it is not, as well as the general irrelevance of definitional debates. This is potentially problematic, given the conflicting way that nanotechnology is framed in the literature relating to the technology’s impact on, and in, the South. At different times, Southern nanotechnology debates have consciously drawn on understandings that correlate with both ‘near-term’ and ‘advanced’ nanotechnology. Whilst most writing presents near-term nanotechnology as the mainstream, there are instances where advanced nanotechnology has also been presented as ‘the reality’ for the South. Bruns, for example, sees answers for global poverty through a future of accessible abundance based on the application of advanced nanotechnology [27]. Al’Afghani, on the other hand, focuses on the need for future environmental laws in the South to incorporate “mechanisms for licensing, supervision and control of emissions and disposal methods for both MNT [molecular nanotechnology] products and nanofactories” [28]. Furthermore, a 2003 briefing document for a United Nations Industrial Development Organisation Expert Group Meeting, predominantly attended by representatives from the Global South, refers to the ability for advanced nanotechnology to address medical, energy and environmental challenges via “…factories operating at the nanometer level, including nanoscale conveyor belts and robotic arms bringing molecular parts together precisely…” [29].\n\nThe bottomline of his paper is that how nanotechnology is framed will affect its regulation. Most debate has been focused on ‘near-term’ nanotechnology as opposed to ‘speculative’ (borrowing Maclurcan’s own words) nanotechnology.\nAs I have gathered mode knowledge on regulation, my perspective on license-management in molecular nanotechnology has changed. The more detailed explanation has to wait a bit however, since I am still preoccupied with water.\nDownload the paper from SSRN (click here).\n Posted by: Movanet \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2011-03-oecd-announces-new-transparency-and.html":{"slug":"blog/2011-03-oecd-announces-new-transparency-and.html","filePath":"blog/2011-03-oecd-announces-new-transparency-and.html.md","title":"OECD announces new transparency and anti-corruption initiative – clean.gov.biz | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":["mailto:news.contact@oecd.org","mailto:Bochra.KRIOUT@oecd.org"],"tags":[],"content":"OECD announces new transparency and anti-corruption initiative – clean.gov.biz\nThursday, March 3, 2011   Movanet \n\nOECD  - Paris 3 March 2011\nOECD announces new transparency and anti-corruption initiative –clean.gov.biz\nThe OECD is developing a new initiative to improve coordination of anti-corruption and transparency initiatives - first within its member countries, and then with all other relevant players, including governments, international organisations, NGOs and the private sector.\n“We are developing a new initiative, clean.gov.biz , that will improve our own anti-corruption tools and reinforce their implementation,” OECD Deputy Secretary-General Richard Boucher said. “We then want to strengthen cooperation with all relevant players to ensure that our instruments complement those of our partners.”\nMr. Boucher discussed the initiative during the March 2-3 meeting of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, hosted at the OECD, underlining how many of its elements complement EITI work. EITI aims to improve natural resource management and reduce corruption by encouraging oil, gas and mining companies to publish the fees, royalties and taxes they pay and commiting governments to transparency about what they receive.\nThe OECD is at the forefront of global anti-corruption efforts. In 2010, its 34 member countries and leading partners including Brazil and Russia agreed to a  Declaration on Propriety, Integrity and Transparency in the Conduct of International Business and Finance. The Declaration is based on OECD instruments including the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Entreprises, which since 1975 set standards for business behavior, and the OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, which set out broad rules to guide business conduct.\nThe OECD  Anti-Bribery Convention commits 38 signatory governments to establish bribery of foreign public officials as a criminal offence. OECD work on public procurement, public sector integrity, including on lobbying and conflicts of interest, as well as budget transparency is at the core of the reform agenda in a growing number of countries. “Political turmoil in highly corrupted regimes reminds us that citizens around the world will no longer accept corruption as business as usual,” Mr. Boucher said.\nThe OECD is also actively cooperating with the G20 in the implementation of its Action Plan on Anti-Corruption, which includes initiatives on foreign bribery, asset recovery, international cooperation, protection of whistle blowers, government integrity and public-private partnerships in fighting corruption. It will co-organise with the French Presidency and the support of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime a G20 conference in April 27-28 on “Joining forces against corruption: G20 business and government.”\nFor further information on the OECD’s anti-corruption work, visit www.oecd.org/corruption or contact the OECD Media Division (tel: + 33 1 4524 9700; news.contact@oecd.org).\n |  **Bochra KRIOUT\n**Media Coordinator  Public Affairs &amp; Communications Directorate - Media Division\n---|---\n|\n2, rue André Pascal - 75775 Paris Cedex 16\nTel: +33 1 45 24 14 28 or +33 1 45 24 97 00 - Fax: +33 1 45 24 94 37\nBochra.KRIOUT@oecd.org || www.oecd.org\nFollow us on:\n          \n Posted by: Movanet \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2011-03-pews-research-transparency-makes.html":{"slug":"blog/2011-03-pews-research-transparency-makes.html","filePath":"blog/2011-03-pews-research-transparency-makes.html.md","title":"PEW's Research: Transparency makes citizen happier, more engaged | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":[],"tags":["good-governance-»","information-»","transparency-»"],"content":"good governance », information », transparency »\nPEW’s Research: Transparency makes citizen happier, more engaged\nFriday, March 4, 2011   Movanet \nPEW has just released its latest survey on transparency of governance in local communities. The result: if the government shares information well, they also feel good about their civic institutions. Following is the summary of PEW’s findings (see p.2):\n\n\nThose who think local government does well in sharing information are also more likely to be satisfied with other parts of civic life such as the overall quality of their community and the performance of government and other institutions, as well as the ability of the entire information environment in their community to give them the information that matters.\nBroadband users are sometimes less satisfied than others with community life. That raises the possibility that upgrades in a local information system might produce more critical, activist citizens.\nSocial media like Facebook and Twitter are emerging as key parts of the civic landscape and mobile connectivity is beginning to affect people’s interactions with civic life. Some 32% of the internet users across the three communities get local news from social networking site; 19% from blogs; 7% from Twitter. And 32% post updates and local news on their social networking sites.\n\n\nThe relationship between transparency system and ‘trust’ is unsurprising. When information is concealed, people will suspect that those holding the information is hiding something. On the contrary, when information is disclosed, people tend to perceive that everything runs well.\nHence, transparency system can also be used to exploit the masses. This is not an argument for opacity, but only to note that ‘disclosure’ is not always equal to ‘transparency’.\nRead PEW’s full report here.\n Posted by: Movanet \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2011-03-will-next-wars-be-fought-over-water.html":{"slug":"blog/2011-03-will-next-wars-be-fought-over-water.html","filePath":"blog/2011-03-will-next-wars-be-fought-over-water.html.md","title":"Will the next wars be fought over water?

That is, when an act of bribery is committed and both of the doers are caught, the bribe giver should be set free and allowed to collect their money, but the bribe taker should be punished.\nThis is indeed an interesting method for deterring corruption by managing its supply-side. It provides incentives for suppliers (bribe-giver) to report and turn over the bribe-taker to the police. He provides caveats however, that bribe giver may have an interest to manage his or her reputation in the underworld (I can imagine that someone like Ayin will have to be ‘credible’ enough in order to earn trust from the bureaucrat – that is to say, to have some sort of an underworld moral code). He also warn the possibilities that false charges of bribery on behalf of the public officials may rise, but this can be managed by increasing penalties for false charges – somewhat dilemmatic for a lawyer.\nAnyway, download the paper here.\nH.T.

Indonesian consumer law Article 8(1) does prohibit business actors to sell computerware without equipping it with Indonesian language manual. Failure to comply entails a 5 year imprisonment. The law was, of course, meant to protect consumer. Sadly, it does not differentiate retail selling with direct selling. As a result, anyone wishing to sell their computer products through direct selling, will be liable for imprisonment, up to 5 years.\n\nKasus ini bermula ketika Dian dan Rendy menawarkan 2 buah Ipad 3G Wi Fi 64 GB di forum jual beli situs www.kaskus.us. Entah karena apa, tawaran ini membuat anggota polisi Polda Metro Jaya melakukan penyelidikan. Lantas, seorang anggota polisi, Eben Patar Opsunggu, menyamar sebagai pembeli. Transaksi pun dilakukan pada 24 November 2010 di City Walk, Tanah Abang, Jakarta Pusat.\nLantas, keduanya ditangkap polisi. Jaksa Penuntut Umum (JPU) Endang, mendakwa keduanya melanggar Pasal 62 Ayat (1) juncto Pasal 8 Ayat (1) Huruf j UU/ UU 8 Tahun 1999 tentang Perlindungan Konsumen karena tidak memiliki manual book berbahasa Indonesia. Lalu, Pasal 52 juncto Pasal 32 Ayat (1) UU Nomor 36/ 1999 tentang Telekomunikasi, karena I Pad belum terkategori alat elektronik komunikasi resmi. Ancaman pidana penjara paling lama 5 tahun penjara. Kasus ini masih berlangsung di PN Jakarta Pusat.\n\nThis is of course, an absolute stupidity, a barrier to trade, and probably a violation of human rights.

Even this one article regulates Private Sector Participation (PSP) very vaguely. The Water Law neither provides clarity on the form of ownership nor the desired regulatory model. The implementing regulation of the Water Law implies that contracts between the government and the private sector will be the desired model, but left no clarity as to how the contract should be regulated.\nAs a result, there is a major lack of regulation in the water services sector. The idea to retain the ownership of assets while allowing PSP through contracts appears to be a modus-vivendi generated by the privatization debate. However, the contracts are not complemented by higher regulation to safeguard consumer’s interest. In many regions, service levels and consumers rights are thus subjected to contractual negotiations to be agreed bilaterally between the authorities and the private sector while citizens are considered only as an auxiliary to the whole process.\nNumber of Pages in PDF File: 11\nKeywords: water, law, privatisation, indonesia, infrastructure, utilities\nWorking Paper Series\nSuggested Citation\nAl ‘Afghani, Mohamad Mova, Anti Privatization Debate, Opaque Rules and Neglected ‘Privatised’ Water Services Provision: Some Lessons from Indonesia (July 14, 2011).

The discussion below is hilarious:\n\nMr Facenna, Counsel for T-Mobile, accepted that radio frequency waves may correctly be characterised as both “energy” and “radiation”. He also accepted that it was a correct use of the English language to say that they were “emitted” from a base station. However, he argued that they nevertheless did not constitute “emissions” for the purposes of the EIR because the circumstances in which the EIR came into existence require the word to be given a particularly narrow meaning. Those circumstances were that EIR implemented the Directive which included, in its fifth recital, a statement that it was itself intended to be consistent with the 1998 United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (“the Aarhus Convention ”).\n\n\nMr Facenna accepted that, even if we accepted that base station radiation should not be treated as “emissions”, he was still faced with the presence of the words “energy” and “radiation” in subparagraph (b) of the definition. However, he argued that these two “factors” do not affect, and are not likely to affect, any of the elements of the environment referred to in subparagraph (a). At one stage this proposition seemed to be leading Mr Facenna and Mr Choudhury, Counsel for the Information Commissioner, into a debate on the scientific properties of radio waves. It was agreed that they are capable of having an effect on solid matter they come into contact with (for example, the agitation of the molecules of a piece of meat by microwaves for the purpose of cooking). However, it was debated whether or not they have any effect on the air through which they pass en route to such matter. We do not feel qualified to express any view on whether the less dense molecular structure of air results in all radio wave frequencies passing through it with no effect at all on individual molecules. We do not believe that it is necessary for us to do so. The definition is not intended to set out a scientific test and its words should be given their plain and natural meaning. On that basis we believe that radio wave emissions that pass through the atmosphere from a base station to any solid component of the natural world are likely to affect one or more of the elements listed in subparagraph (a) or the…\n\n\nFor all of these reasons we conclude that “emissions” in both subparagraph (b) of the definition of environmental information and regulation 12(9) should be given its plain and natural meaning and not the artificially narrow one set out in the IPPC Directive. As we have indicated it is accepted, on that basis, that radio wave radiation emanating from a base station is an emission.\n\nIt’s really nice to spice up the court with some Planck/Maxwell wave/particle duality \n Posted by: Movanet \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2011-11-international-water-law-scholarship.html":{"slug":"blog/2011-11-international-water-law-scholarship.html","filePath":"blog/2011-11-international-water-law-scholarship.html.md","title":"International Water Law Scholarship Programme | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":[],"tags":["water-»"],"content":"water »\nInternational Water Law Scholarship Programme\nMonday, November 28, 2011   Movanet \nThe Global Water Partnership together with IHP-HELP Centre for Water Law, Policy and Science, under the auspices of UNESCO, at the University of Dundee, is looking to build on their successful 2011 International Water Law Programme (www.dundee.ac.uk/water/workshop), and offer scholarships for 30 participants to undertake a module in International Water Law, in Dundee 11-29 June 2012.\nScholarship recipients are responsible for all travel (to/from Dundee) and subsistence (food/accommodation) costs.

On the second anniversary of the United Nations recognition of the right to water, many will put down their swords for a moment to take stock of the efficacy of such legal battles in challenging privatized water services.\nThe Municipal Services Project research  Shields and Swords: Legal Tools for Public Water finds that their success has been mixed, with some legal actions managing to get the right to water written into law or banning private water provision altogether, while others have met with partial success. Among others, it analyzes at length the campaigns that unfolded in Indonesia and draws lessons for other water movements around the world.\nIndeed, in 2004-2005 a group of legal aid foundations and NGOs lodged a request for a judicial review of Indonesia’s Water Resources Law widely seen as advancing water privatization, and as contravening the Constitution which establishes that the water sector shall be controlled by the state. Although the Constitutional Court rejected the petition, the litigation did establish various water service regulatory safeguards and conditions, thus creating some space for future action by civil society.\nThe decision was silent on pre-existing private water concessions, however, which remains a vexed issue.\nJakarta’s resounding call for public water\nSome lasting civil society networks emerged from the struggle and continue to mobilize around the right to water and public control over this essential service. On June 10, the Jakarta Globe told the story of the People’s Coalition for the Right to Water (KRuHA)’s year-long effort to access information on Jakarta’s water management, as guaranteed by law. The citizen group is asking for disclosure of data used to calculate water tariffs, such as capital and operational expenditures as well as financial projections.\nKRuHA’s request set the scene for a theatrical exchange between private providers and publicly owned PAM Jaya, eachtrying to make the other carry the can for the release of the key documents. PAM Jaya is supposed to be publicly accountable for the concession contracts but has been hiding stubbornly behind a “confidentiality clause” that protects “all commercial and technical information” to justify its hesitancy.\nSo the citizen group launched legal action in late 2011 to end the deadlock through Indonesia’s Public Information Commission (KIP). In early June 2012, the process entered adjudication. And KRuHA will keep up the pressure.\nLegal avenues for reform\nIn short, litigation campaigns have proven to be an effective way to tap into widespread public opposition to reverse or challenge privatization and, as a counter-strategy, appear to be growing in popularity around the world. Where they have been less successful is in defining alternative models of public water services; this next step will be crucial to ensure that sustainable models fill in the vacuums left by private providers.\nThese cases demonstrate that privatization can be challenged on its own legal terms, exposing it to closer public scrutiny. But using or creating a new law is only the first step in what must be a longer political struggle to provide genuinely democratic forms of public water provision. As such, legal campaigns must also strive toward building frameworks for regulating, maintaining and monitoring progressive management of services after they become public. For that reason dedicated and committed activism is more critical to the success of campaigns than the legal tools themselves.\nFinally, whether or not ‘rights’ frameworks are invoked, pro-public activists derive authority, legitimacy and solidarity in their legal campaigns from the international recognition of the right to water of July 28, 2010. From leftist perspectives there is much debate about whether this vision of law can ever be useful for radical social and economic change, many arguing it is ideologically biased toward the status quo and private interests; as such, legal tools are seen as potentially harmful to radical movements.\nNotwithstanding, our research shows that the right to water can be viewed as an enabling framework that, although potentially friendly to privatization, can be used along with other laws to build, mobilize and legitimize campaigns opposed to privatization.\nTwo resounding victories in Berlin and Italy – two other cases explored in our study –are marking the right to water’s first anniversary at the UN. In Berlin, the city administration recently announced it was buying the shares of private company RWE in the water utility, raising its stake to 75.05% from 50.1%. In February 2011, Berlin residents had voted by a margin of 98.2% after a Berlin Water Table campaign to pass a draft bill to force the municipal administration to disclose secret agreements on the partial privatization of the city’s water services. Some months later, hopes for remunicipalization are coming true.\nIn Italy, after the Berlusconi government went ahead with its privatization agenda despite a citizen-led referendum that rejected by 96 per cent the proposed privatization of the country’s water supply in June 2011, the Italian Constitutional Court ruled this month to uphold the people’s will to keep water in public hands. The unrelenting efforts of the  _Forum Italiano dei Movimenti per l’Acqua _have no doubt gone a long way to safeguarding what had been gained from hard mobilization work.\nLet’s keep building on these foundations, everywhere.\nJackie Dugard is Executive Director of theSocio-Economic Rights Institute of South Africa (SERI) and visiting Senior Fellow, School of Law, University of the Witwatersrand.\n_\n_\nKatherine Drage is a former Intern at SERI and is currently an articled clerk at Withers LLP (London).\n_\n_\nMadeleine Bélanger Dumontier is Communications Manager for theMunicipal Services Project (MSP), a global research initiative that explores alternatives to the privatization and commercialization of service provision in the electricity, health, water and sanitation sectors.\n Posted by: Movanet \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2012-09-economy-indonesia-should-improve.html":{"slug":"blog/2012-09-economy-indonesia-should-improve.html","filePath":"blog/2012-09-economy-indonesia-should-improve.html.md","title":"Economy: Indonesia should improve governance, productivity and tax collection to promote inclusive growth | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":["mailto:news.contact@oecd.org","tel:-percent2B-331-45-24-97-00","mailto:Helen.Fisher@oecd.org"],"tags":[],"content":"Economy: Indonesia should improve governance, productivity and tax collection to promote inclusive growth\nWednesday, September 26, 2012   Unknown \nOECD - Paris, 27 September 2012 ____\nIndonesia should improve governance, productivity and tax collection to promote inclusive growth ____\nIndonesia has improved its macro-economic and structural policies over the last 15 years. Its economy, with strong and stable growth rates of 5-6.6%, is catching up with other countries in the region and allowing it to focus on a development agenda. ____\nTo reach the objective of becoming one of the world’s 10 largest economies by 2025, the government’s next step must be to move ahead with reforms that will take full advantage of this progress and unlock the country’s full potential, says OECD 2012 Economic Survey: Indonesia .____\n“Indonesia has made substantial economic, institutional and social progress. It has weathered the economic crisis quite well and poverty has come down markedly,” said OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría. “The government’s challenge now is to boost productivity, reduce energy subsidies and raise tax collection to finance key infrastructure, social and environmental programmes. Investing in an effective social safety net and improving education and skills will make higher living standards accessible to all and ensure that future growth will be inclusive and sustainable.”____\nInvesting in innovation and boosting productivity, particularly in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) should be a priority. They employ 97% of the workforce but produce only 57% of value-added. This could be achieved through comprehensive reforms, including facilitating the formalisation of economic activity, easier access to finance and expanding the pool of qualified workers. The Survey suggests that policy reforms could focus on improving banks’ access to information on the creditworthiness of potential clients and developing alternative financing sources, such as venture capital or micro-finance.\nRegarding labour markets, the Survey suggests a balanced approach: easing regulations to make the formal labour market more attractive and aligning minimum wage increases to productivity growth in provinces where it is already high; while at the same time introducing unemployment benefits, coupled with individual unemployment-insurance accounts, and investing in people’s skills. ____\nTo finance wider coverage of its social security system and develop its infrastructure, Indonesia should increase its unduly low 12% tax-to-GDP ratio, by removing tax exemptions on employer-provided fringe benefits, many VAT exemptions and tax holidays for specific sectors or investment projects. It should also increase taxes in the resource sector. Improving tax compliance of high-income individuals could increase public revenue and raise the fairness of the tax system. Overall, increasing tax revenues can best be achieved through broadening tax bases and improving tax administration.____\nOECD’s first Review of Regulatory Reform for Indonesia looks at the changes to the regulatory framework which will be necessary to implement the development and growth agenda of the Indonesian Government, including the recommendations of the Economic Survey. ____\nThe report recommends that the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs implements a government-wide policy to strengthen institutions, optimise co-ordination among ministries and improve regulations, based on international best practice. In particular, measures to further develop the Indonesian market and increase private investment in infrastructure need to be fostered by coherent policies. ____\nAll new regulations, the Review stresses, should serve the public interest and not restrict trade, particularly in the priority areas of major infrastructure investment in the ports, rail and shipping sectors. ____\nThe 2012 Economic Survey and the Regulatory Reform Review of Indonesia have been developed through policy dialogue between OECD committees and officials of the Government of Indonesia.____\nTo receive a copy of OECD’s Economic Survey: Indonesia and Review of Regulatory Reform for Indonesia, journalists should e-mail news.contact@oecd.org or telephone: + 331 45 24 97 00.

The review is a collaboration between dropbydrop, Watsan Working Group of the East Nusa Tenggara Province, UNICEF and the Sikka Regency.\nMost of the challenges found are due to ambiguities of the legal framework at the national level. The review highlighted the lack of acknowledgement towards community based watsan in national legislation.\nAssets ownership is one of the major issue during the review. Neither the national policy nor the national legislation provide clarification as to the actual owner of the assets. There is a general understanding that the assets “belong to the community” but what “community” actually means is not clear in the legal framework.\nOne of the aspirations that develops during the review is that the assets should be owned by villages but operated by the communities. The review provide recommendation as to how this could be translated into provisions in a regional by law and also provide solution for ownership arrangements for entities other than villages.\nThe lack of clarification on assets ownerships would affect the sustainability and security of community based watsan, which is developed mostly through fundings from the World Bank, AusAid and various other institutions.\nSome of the findings from the review is currently being discussed at the national level.\nFor further information please contact dropbydrop’s senior water lawyer Mohamad Mova Al’Afghani: mova(at)alafghani(dot)info\n Posted by: Unknown \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2012-10-anti-blasphemy-tool-diplomatic-blunder.html":{"slug":"blog/2012-10-anti-blasphemy-tool-diplomatic-blunder.html","filePath":"blog/2012-10-anti-blasphemy-tool-diplomatic-blunder.html.md","title":"Anti-blasphemy tool a diplomatic blunder | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Anti-blasphemy tool a diplomatic blunder\nThursday, October 11, 2012   Movanet \nThe following is my op-ed piece in today’s Jakarta Post.\nAt the 67th session of the United Nations General Assembly, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY) called on world leaders to “enact an international instrument to effectively prevent incitement to hostility or violence based on religions or beliefs”. These words are a verbatim citation of SBY’s speech.\nThus, SBY – in his official United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) speech — did not state that he demanded the international community enforce an international blasphemy law. The term “blasphemy” is found nowhere in his speech. What he officially pushed for is the enactment of an international instrument that could prevent incitement to hostility or violence.\nThis is where the move constitutes a blunder. First, there is a big difference between a blasphemy law and a law that punishes incitement of hostility. Second, laws which restrict incitement and hate speech are actually part of international law and have been practiced in by international courts. Third, the Innocence of Muslims movie, which SBY also referred to in his speech, may not necessarily qualify as an “incitement to hostility or violence”.\nLet us now discuss the first blunder. The media have quoted statements from ministers and other government officials who hinted at Indonesia’s quest for an international blasphemy law, which contradicts SBY’s remarks at the UNGA forum. So what exactly is Indonesia’s diplomatic position concerning blasphemy? Does it seek to restrict free speech which incites hostility or violence or does it aim to enact a blasphemy law?\nA blasphemy law protects religion, although in practice this usually translates into the “dominant” religion and its symbols. Thus, irrespective of whether something is intended to provoke violence or not, to the extent that it is considered denigrating of religion and religious symbols it can be restricted and punished.\nSuch an international blasphemy law would be absurd and inconceivable. Every founder of a new religion has been accused of blasphemy by the society they served. Thus blasphemy is required for a religion to exist. The Indonesian Shiite cleric Tajul Muluk, for example, has been convicted of blasphemy and jailed for it.\nIt would thus be unthinkable for diplomats from predominantly Shiite Iran to sit together with their Indonesian counterparts and agree on an international blasphemy provision as it would mean that they approve of persecution of Shia followers.\nThe second blunder is that SBY’s call for a restriction of free speech that incites violence is already part of the existing international law. The Civil and Political Covenant provides clauses that restrict freedom of expression on the grounds of public health, public order and morality. Now, why would SBY say that we need such a law when we already have one?\nThird, SBY relating the international uproar surrounding Innocence of Muslims to the requirement for “an international instrument” to effectively prevent incitement to hostility or violence based on religion shows a level of disconnect. The movie does not directly incite hostility or provoke violence. Rather, hostility and violence are an indirect result of the movie.\nThere is a clear line separating these concepts. In order for an act of expression to incite violence, it must provoke people to commit violence. In the famous case of Radio-Télévision Libre des Milles Collines (RTLM) in Rwanda, it is clear that the radio incited Hutus to kill the Tutsis. Thus, the RTLM was held responsible for its role in the genocide. The Tutsis were therefore the direct victims of RTLM hate speech.\nThe RTLM case is different from the Innocence of Muslims movie. The latter does not contain any incitement for people to physically hurt Muslims and indeed no Muslims have been killed or hurt as a result of the movie’s provocation. What happened is rather the contrary. Some people — who happen to be Muslims — got angry and then killed others or got themselves killed in the process.\nUndoubtedly, the movie is indeed disparaging and could lead to wrong perceptions about Islam and Muslims. However, to argue that such incorrect perceptions cause physical violence to Muslims would be too far-fetched. Because of this, SBY’s argument linking the recent uproar caused by the movie to his proposal for an international instrument to prevent incitement to hostility is unsound. Recently reports have abounded that Indonesia will lead the formulation of a roadmap towards a so-called international anti-blasphemy protocol. Whosoever gets involved in the process of drafting such roadmap will have to deal with these blunders.\nPerhaps Indonesia is trying to play its card as the world’s largest predominantly Muslim nation to gain sympathy from the Organization of Islamic Conference countries. Or perhaps, this is a maneuver to send a signal to the UN Human Rights Council that Indonesia’s bad marks on the freedom of religion have some “roots” in the international arena.\nNevertheless, this whole anti-blasphemy protocol, instruments and road map is a waste of Indonesia’s diplomatic resources. This manuevering does not present a good image to the world of Indonesia as a moderate Muslim nation that succeeds in reconciling democracy and human rights with Islam. It also does not send a good signal to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) countries because there are inconsistencies in Indonesia’s diplomatic stance. It appears to me that Indonesia doesn’t really know what it wants.\n Posted by: Movanet \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2012-10-disclosure-of-government-contracts-in.html":{"slug":"blog/2012-10-disclosure-of-government-contracts-in.html","filePath":"blog/2012-10-disclosure-of-government-contracts-in.html.md","title":"Disclosure of Government Contracts in Indonesia | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":[],"tags":["contract-»","regulation-»","transparency-»"],"content":"contract », regulation », transparency »\nDisclosure of Government Contracts in Indonesia\nThursday, October 18, 2012   Movanet \nA paper titled “Perjanjian Badan Publik Dengan Pihak Ketiga: Anotasi Pasal 11 ayat (1) (e) Undang Undang Nomor 14 Tahun 2008” is available for download (only in Bahasa Indonesia).

When Jokowi later has to deal with Jakarta’s drinking water situation, he will realize that there is a grain of truth in this argument.\nWhile his predecessor Fauzi Bowo seemed to be focused more on technocratic “grand strategies” to solve the overall water problem, to my knowledge, Jokowi does not have any sophisticated plan. From media interviews we can tell that Jokowi’s emphasis on Jakarta’s drinking water problem will be on quality and affordability i.e. a pro-poor approach. One of Jokowi’s promises during his campaign was to provide access to water for low-income citizens of North Jakarta, either at an affordable rate, or even for free.\nBut, how can he deliver on such a promise? I shall explain the complexities below.\nFirst, water provision is a natural-legal-monopoly. What this means is that people cannot just extend pipes to a community outside the existing network because the cost of duplicating networks is high. As a result, there are usually only one or two companies serving a particular region. The monopoly is not only in terms of economics, but also a legal one. Every new entrant or operation may have to gain permission from incumbent companies.\nSecond, there is a trade-off between service levels and network expansion. Suppose that the companies agree to expand the network, with constraints on bulkwater sources, pressure and continuity of supply other areas might be affected. Thus, a part of Jakarta that is currently well-served might become compromised unless the government finds a new bulkwater source.\nThird, there are significant costs associated with network expansion to the poor. In addition to capital expenditure on long-term assets, collection rates will become a major issue. Expanding services to low-income citizens means risking either non-payment or increased debt for suppliers. Various researches indicate that the poor have both the willingness and capacity to pay for water services. However, low-income consumers require flexibility in the form of payment-in-arrears or in installments.\nAside from the above points, unless appropriately addressed, the current governance structure of Jakarta’s water services could impede Jokowi’s pro-poor water plan. As we are aware, there are at least three main regulatory actors in Jakarta’s drinking water services: the city-owned waterworks company PAM Jaya, the concessionaires (Palyja and Aetra) and the governor.\nThe concession works in such a way that PAM Jaya must purchase the volume of water sold by the concessionaire to the consumer. Thus, from the concessionaire’s point of view, aside from constraints on bulkwater sources, they have no objection at all to serving the poor since they will be paid no matter what.\nHowever, PAM Jaya may have objections to expanding the network to the poor, because if the revenue from tariff collection is not enough to cover the cost, then PAM Jaya will have to borrow money to pay the concessionaire. This means that if the poor cannot pay or can only pay in arrears, PAM Jaya will be in debt to the private sector. It is worth noting that at the moment, PAM Jaya already has huge debts with the private sector.\nAnother consequence of the above system is that PAM Jaya’s debt would reflect upon the concessionaire’s balance sheet and affect its overall financial health. Put simply: connecting to the poor may affect the collection rates, low collection rates means that PAM Jaya would be in debt to the concessionaire and in turn PAM Jaya’s debt to the concessionaire means higher account receivables in the concessionaire balance sheet. If the concessionaires only have high account receivables but lack cash, how can they have enough funds to invest in further network expansion and finance the existing operations and maintenance?\nWhat the above shows is that there are structural disincentives in connecting to the poor. The concessionaire might be able to resort to outside financing for cash that would support a pro-poor program but for PAM Jaya this could be perceived as a liability that put strains on its balance sheet. A direct interventionist approach will also not work in Jakarta because it is legally impossible. Jokowi will soon find out that the governance of Jakarta water services is a complex web of various actors and interests, not only local and national, but also international. The nature of private sector participation with foreign investment means that the corporations investing in water services are backed by international treaties.\nAny disputes could provoke intervention not only from the central government, but could also take place through diplomatic channels. This has already occurred in the past.\nAll of these challenges should not discourage Jokowi from his initial plan to provide services to the poor. There are several things that Jokowi could do to advance his water-for-the-poor program.\nHe should first address the lack of incentives from regulatory actors in connecting to the poor. Next, he should consult the poor on how they want to be connected to the network. The poor, together with companies and other actors should sit together to discuss the issue. Finally, Jokowi should try to reform the existing legislation which penalizes the poor for late payments.\nAs I have said, low-income citizens require flexibility in payments but the current legislation restricts this. In order to achieve all this, of course, he needs sufficient support from the Jakarta City Council.\n Posted by: Movanet \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2012-11-fw-your-paper-makes-ssrn-top-ten-list.html":{"slug":"blog/2012-11-fw-your-paper-makes-ssrn-top-ten-list.html","filePath":"blog/2012-11-fw-your-paper-makes-ssrn-top-ten-list.html.md","title":"Fw: Your Paper Makes SSRN Top Ten List | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":["mailto:management@ssrn.com","mailto:movanet@gmail.com","mailto:AuthorSupport@SSRN.com"],"tags":["water-»"],"content":"water »\nFw: Your Paper Makes SSRN Top Ten List\nWednesday, November 28, 2012   Unknown \nSent from BlackBerry® on 3\n\nFrom: “management@ssrn.com” management@ssrn.com\nDate: Wed, 28 Nov 2012 05:35:24 -0500 (EST)\nTo: movanet@gmail.com\nSubject: Your Paper Makes SSRN Top Ten List\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDear Mohamad Mova Al’Afghani:\nYour paper, “OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN INTEGRATING COMMUNITY-BASED WATER SERVICES INTO THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK: AN INDONESIA CASE STUDY”, was recently listed on SSRN’s Top Ten download list for: Natural Resources Law &amp; Policy eJournal.\nAs of 11/28/2012, your paper has been downloaded 41 times.

The first is the problem of defining and delienating the boundaries between “community-based” versus the so called “institution-based” (corporate water services). Second is the ambiguity of the concept of “community” and the lack of acknowledgement on community’s rights and previleges under national legal framework. Third, also related to the first challenge, is the potential of overlap between the regimes of corporate water utilities and that of the community based, where inevitably, one might be sacrificed at the expense of another. Fourth is the problem of sanction attached to the by-laws, such as in criminalizing open defecation. The Fifth is the problem of assets types and ownership. There appears to be unclarity on community assets ownership and this could mean that such assets are ownerless which renders it vulnerable to taking or confiscation from third parties. Finally, there is a problem with the national legal requirement to determine a “minimum service standard”.\nNumber of Pages in PDF File: 18\nKeywords: water, governance, sanitation, law, legal, infrastructure, environment, public health, policy\nworking papers series\nDownload Link at SSRN Page.\n Posted by: Movanet \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2012-12-dam-infrastructure-do-not-let-them-just.html":{"slug":"blog/2012-12-dam-infrastructure-do-not-let-them-just.html","filePath":"blog/2012-12-dam-infrastructure-do-not-let-them-just.html.md","title":"Dam Infrastructure: Do Not Let Them Just Become Monuments | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":[],"tags":["water-»"],"content":"water »\nDam Infrastructure: Do Not Let Them Just Become Monuments\nTuesday, December 4, 2012   Movanet \n__\n**“A memorandum of understanding had to be made because several regencies do not yet have RTRW”, Hasan said. As of October 2012, there are only 205 regencies/cities, out of a total 498 regencies/cities, that have completed RTRW. Of the 33 provinces, only 14 provinces have finalised their RTRW.\n**\nMohamad Mova Al ‘Afghani, a doctoral candidate at the UNESCO Center for Water Law Policy at the University of Dundee, Scotland, says that it is more appropriate for RTRW to follow “water planning”. “Thus, we bring people, bring farmers to the water, instead of water to the people”, he said.\nSource:Indonesia Infrastructure Initiative (Indii) website\n__\n_KOMPAS, 23 November, 2012, Page 35, Section: Fokus Ketahanan Pangan\n_ By Haryo Damardono\n“I have a message even to workers, so that workers would contribute their energy to the fullest for the implementation of this project. Remember, this project does not belong to a single capitalist, but this is a project of the state, a project for the people, a project for all of us”, said Ir Soekarno, when visiting Jatiluhur Dam Project, 19 September, 1965.\nFrom his speech, the strong desire of Ir Soekarno - the proclaimer [of Indonesian independence] - could be felt, that Jatiluhur Dam should be quickly completed. This is because Jatiluhur was key to increasing agricultural productivity, in addition to controlling floods and meeting the needs of raw water.\nInitiated by irrigation expert WJ van Blommestein in 1930, Jatiluhur was originally designed to irrigate an area of 517,240ha. However, when President Soeharto inaugurated it on 26 August, 1967 the remaining area was only 240,000ha. Much reduced, but still it was categorically large in size and the condition continued to be excellent.\nNot surprisingly, Mohammad Hasan, Director General of Water Resources of the Ministry of Public Works, expressed disappointment when he witnessed the conversion of land [that had taken place] in Bekasi, especially when he observed the land use conversion in the West Tarum Parent Channel. Its inspection road has even been transformed into Kalimalang public road.\nDue to its strategic location, the Bekasi - Cikarang corridor has become a magnet for industrial estate and housing developments. Businessmen have long telescoped potential profits there. From the centre of Jakarta, Cikarang is only 24km away, while from the Port of Tanjung Priok it is 35km away.\nThe glittering gold in Cikarang is demonstrated by publicly listed company PT Bekasi Fajar Industrial Estate, Tbk (BEST), which recorded revenue of Rp 661.97 billion as of the third quarter of 2012, up 88.50 percent compared to revenue in the third quarter of 2011.\nMeanwhile PT Lippo Cikarang, Tbk, has also armed itself with a new toll gate at KM 34 + 700 in Jakarta - Cikampek Toll Road. Lippo will soon transform 3,000ha of land into industrial estate and residential area.\nChairman of Indonesian Water Resources Network (SDA), Sudar D Atmanto, noted the importance of a strong will to stem land conversion. “The fact shows that population growth in Citarum River region has been recorded at 1.7 percent, while the entire West Java has registered growth of 1.2 percent. This is an example of how attractive the river banks are as places of domicile, so that the land will increasingly be annexed”, he said.\nAnother fact is that, each year, there are 110,000ha of agricultural lands being converted. The modus may be illegal or legal, in line with spatial planning revisions. In the context of Jatiluhur’s presence, is food agriculture in the Citarum region, and Java, still the focus?\nIs there really a future for agriculture in Java, which has recorded a planting index (IP) of 1.9, with productivity of 5.5 tonnes per ha? These numbers glaringly show imbalance, given that the national IP is 1.4 and the average productivity is 4.6 tonnes per ha.\nIn his book titled Infrastructure Management and Regional Development (2012), Bambang Susantono, said that the economic corridor of Java is focused more on the food and beverage, textile, machinery, and spare parts industries. So, where is the location of food agriculture of the future? The Government’s vision turns to the Sulawesi corridor and the Papua - Maluku corridor, with its Merauke Integrated Food and Energy Estate (MIFEE). Some 1.2 million ha of land is allocated for MIFEE, although it is not monopolised for rice, but it may include sugarcane and palm oil.\n**\nSpatial Layout****\n** With regard to the conversion of agricultural land, Hasan chooses to speak of the future. “The commanders are indeed the spatial layout plans (RTRW). Without them, Public Works will no longer build any water infrastructures,” he said.\nOn 7 November, for example, Public Works gave its agreement to build Batang Asai Irrigation Area, which covers 6,210ha in Sarolangun Regency, Jambi. The development [process] begins after regional leaders and local communities sign an agreement on sustainable development of agricultural area.\n“A memorandum of understanding had to be made because several regencies do not yet have RTRW”, Hasan said. As of October 2012, there are only 205 regencies/cities, out of a total 498 regencies/cities, that have completed RTRW. Of the 33 provinces, only 14 provinces have finalised their RTRW.\nMohamad Mova Al ‘Afghani, a doctoral candidate at the UNESCO Center for Water Law Policy at the University of Dundee, Scotland, says that it is more appropriate for RTRW to follow “water planning”. “Thus, we bring people, bring farmers to the water, instead of water to the people”, he said.\nIn the midst of the many problems on the sustainability of agricultural land, Director General of Infrastructure and Facilities of the Ministry of Agriculture, Sumardjo Gatot Irianto, remains optimistic. The ministry’s main weapon is Law no. 41/2009 on Protection of Sustainable Food Agricultural Land.\n“We are also currently conducting an audit of agricultural fields with a target completion in December 2012”, said Gatot. He also urged local governments to not allocate lands for purposes of just meeting their food needs.\n**\nRehabilitation****\n** Ministry of Agriculture deals with [sizes of] land areas, while Ministry of Public Works ensures continuous construction of infrastructure. Of the 7.23 million ha of irrigated rice/agricultural fields in Indonesia, only 11 percent have guaranteed supply of water from reservoirs or dams. Hasan gave an indication that, in 2013, some 13 dams will be built, from an inventory of 100 units of potential dams.\nThe best solution to minimise land conversion needs to be quickly found, then determination of RTRW should be encouraged, at least making sure that the land area for food production remains preserved. It should not happen that the reservoirs and dams will be mere monuments. Understandably, they cost trillions of rupiah to build. Even, the construction cost of irrigation per ha already reaches Rp 30–40 million.\nThen, what is no less important is rehabilitation of the irrigation networks. Especially because, based on a technical audit (rapid assessment) of the irrigation system in 2010, in fact 55 percent of the irrigation facilities are in damaged conditions. Most of these are under the local governments’ authority.\nThe problem is, about 4.8 million ha of rice/agricultural fields are under the authority of the local governments, with special allocation fund (DAK) of “only” Rp 1.4 trillion. Those under the central government’s authority involve 2.4 million ha of land, with funding of Rp 2 trillion.\n“The money for the regions may be used up on personnel expenditure. They have no money”, said Hasan.\nSudar has a different view. When calculated from the state budget (APBN) allocation worth Rp 1,300–1,400 trillion per year, funding needs for irrigation at the local level account for only 1.8 percent of the total development budget allocation of the regions.\n“That’s peanuts (small), nothing. Regional/local governments should compensate it from their respective personnel expenditure. It has to be. If not, no matter how big the DAK is, it would never be enough”, he said.\nThe land has been maintained, the dams are built, while the irrigation networks are rehabilitated. All for the sake of food security. But what if in the end land conversion has continued to take place?\n“Well, it is difficult. The stages are indeed from agrarian to industrial, it cannot jump directly to services”, said Mova.\n Posted by: Movanet \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2012-12-evidence-from-space-study-for-european.html":{"slug":"blog/2012-12-evidence-from-space-study-for-european.html","filePath":"blog/2012-12-evidence-from-space-study-for-european.html.md","title":"Evidence From Space: Study for the European Space Agency on the Use of Space-Derived Earth Observation Information and Evidence in Judicial and Administrative Proceedings | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":["assets/pdfs/asset_00091_1342722048_Evidence_from_Space_25_June_2012_-_No_Cover_zip.pdf"],"tags":["water-»"],"content":"water »\nEvidence From Space: Study for the European Space Agency on the Use of Space-Derived Earth Observation Information and Evidence in Judicial and Administrative Proceedings\nSunday, December 9, 2012   Movanet \nThe London Institute for Space Policy and Law completed its study on Earth Observation (EO), commissioned by the European Space Agency (ESA).

It also notes, however, that the transport sector is the second largest contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally, contributing 23% of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil-fuel combustion, as well as a significant source of pollutants which pose serious risks to human health. ____\n\nTransport emissions could double by 2050 if governments fail to address unsustainable patterns in existing models, the OECD said. The new report encourages policymakers and private sector actors to shift investments away from emissions-intensive transport infrastructure that is not resilient to climate change towards more sustainable transport modes, such as metros, passenger rail, bus rapid transit or electric vehicle charging stations. ____\n\n“It is urgent that investment in transportation moves towards building right, not just building more. The private sector has a key role to play in this shift, which will help governments to meet the pressing economic, social and environmental challenges they will face over coming decades.” OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría said during the launch of the report at the International Transport Forum’s annual summit in Leipzig, Germany. “Governments on their part must play a central role in mobilising private sector investment for sustainable transport infrastructure.” ____\n\nThe new OECD working paper provides governments with a comprehensive toolkit of key policy instruments to mobilise private investment in sustainable transport infrastructure. It builds on the OECD’s Green Investment Policy Framework, and emphasises the need for integrated, domestic policy frameworks to address investment barriers.____\nThe OECD Green Investment Policy Framework ____\n____\n\nSource: Adapted from Corfee-Morlot et al., 2012.____\nKey policy recommendations include: ____\n____\n__· __Adopt a “co-benefits” approach.**** While sustainable transport projects are often driven by a range of policy objectives, including reduced traffic congestion and local air pollution, when properly implemented they can also help achieve climate change goals. The Bus Rapid Transit system in Mexico City reduced travel time for users by 40%, significantly reduced exposure to particulate matter, and in addition achieved annual GHG emissions savings of 110.000 tons. ____\n____\n__· __Use pricing instruments such as carbon prices, fuel and vehicle taxes, reform of fossil-fuel subsidies and congestion charges**** to shift incentives away from fossil-fuel based road transport. Successful congestion charges operate in London, Stockholm and Singapore. ____\n\n__· __Implement regulations and standards that complement pricing instruments, such as zoning policies and land use planning, standards and public procurement programs. ____\n____\n· Use innovative financial tools and risk-sharing mechanisms to mobilise new sources of financing. Land value capture tools, for example, aim to harness revenues from the increase in property value generated by new or renovated transport infrastructure. They can be used as part of the capital financing mix to improve projects’ profitability, as in the case of the Hong Kong transit railway Setting suitable financing vehicles is particularly critical to attract institutional investors such as pension funds.\n\n__· __Build capacity and implement soft policy tools to change business and consumer behaviour, such as public awareness campaigns. ____\nThe working paper is available here, and is summarized here.

FOI laws assist in ensuring access to environmental information by people and communities. However, information on air and water quality and pollutants released into the environment needs to be released proactively, in formats that are easily understandable by the public, without a request.\n2. Government needs to adopt legal requirements for the collection and production of environmental information.\n3. Laws that guarante a specific right of access to environmental information without a request need to be operationalized to ensure quick and timely access to environmental information.\n4. The right of access to environmental information should be promoted at the international and regional level. The Aarhus Convention and the Latin American and the Carribean (LAC) regional process can serve as a model for the Asian region.\n5. The United Nations Environment Programme’s (UNEP) Guidelines for the Development of National Legislation on Access to Information, Public Participation and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (the Bali Guidelines) should be utilized by Governments in the region to raise standards of national legislation on access to environmental information.\n6. Governments in the Asian region need to improve FOI laws to comply with international standards.\nAreas of priority in the region include:\na. Protection of public officials from being sued for the release of information under FOI laws;\nb. Penalties and administrative sanctions where public officials intentionally breach the law;\nc. Reforming broad exemptions in FOI laws and ensuring the public interest is considered in\ndeliberations whether to grant or refuse information;\nd. Removing limitations of the right to information to only citizens;\ne. Lowering fees for making requests and obtaining copies of documents;\nf. Removing requirements for people to provide a reason to make a request;\ng. Inclusion of private corporations that are required to carry out public functions and state\nowned enterprises within the scope of the law;\nh. Developing up-to-date archive and records management laws that mandate the collection,\nretention and management of information by governments;\ni. Ensuring that information commissioners are independent and have sufficient power to order\nthe release of information.\n7. Effective implementation of FOI laws helps to expand access to environmental information.\nAreas which need to be targeted for improvement in the region include;\na. Responding to requests within the timelines under the law;\nb. Providing appropriate incentives to government officials to ensure compliance with FOI\nrequirements;\nc. Allocation of necessary budgetary and other resources to ensure efficient and timely\nadministration;\nd. Appointment of information commissioners with the tools to ensure adequate enforcement of the\nFOI law and providing methods for the disclosure of their decisions;\ne. Implementation of proactive disclosure provisions in FOI laws;\nf. Public education and training to empower civil society and communities to make full use of the\nright;\ng. Improving training for government officials and systems for tracking, transferring and monitoring requests, and regular monitoring and\nreporting on the operation of the law;\nh. Collecting statistics on the number of requests submitted by the public, publication of FOI\ndecisions, information declared public, and decisions or recommendations of information commisioners;\ni. Review of the operation and compliance with the law, by legislative bodies and information\ncommissioners.\n8. Significant barriers for local communities exist that impair their access to environmental\ninformation across the region. Barriers include costs and limited information being available at\nlocal public authorities as well as understandability of technical information.\n9. The public has a right to participate in the setting of priorities on the types of\nenvironmental information to be released proactively including, but not limited to, planning\napplications, environmental impact assessments, permits, air and water quality monitoring\ninformation, and inspection reports.\n10. Environmental information must be available in a usable and understandable form. There is a\nneed to analyze and interpret data to make it meaningful for all stakeholders. Academics,\nGovernment Agencies and civil society, and the media all have a role to play in this process.\n11. It is important to release environmental information and data at all stages of collection and\nanalysis on the internet. Information must be made available to local communities and in a wide\nrange of formats including internet, tv, radio, newspaper, paper records and mobile phones. It must\nbe systematic, timely, reliable, comprehensive, user friendly, accessible, inexpensive and\naccurate.\n12. The use of information enables public participation. Transparency must be guaranteed and\noopportunities need to be given for public participation in\na. Policy making\nb. Formulation of standards for release of air and water pollutants c. Planning stage\nd. Application for permission for development e. Grant and Renewal of Permits\nf. Environmental impact assessment processes\ng. Enforcement and reporting of violations\nh. Environmental disclosure programs, for example Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers\n13. Capacity building and training of civil society to support communities to interpret data and\nuse of information will foster support for transparency amongst all sectors of society.\n14. Governments must present environmental information in graphic representations such as maps and\ncharts, using symbols and colours to identify risks, and demonstrate breaches or compliance with\nstandards, and provide meaningful and relevant information.\n15. Access to corporate, facility and state-owned enterprise information that reveals pollutant\ndischarges and its impact on the environment is limited in many countries in the region. Emission and Discharge\ndata from the corporate sector must be provided to the Government to enable monitoring of the\nenvironment.\nThis information shall not fall within the category of commercially confidential information as it\ndirectly relates to the environment and public health and should be released in the public interest. Rules\nshould not allow claims of commercial confidentiality or trade secrets to supercede public interest\nas this information directly relates to environmental and public health.\n16. Stronger Legislative frameworks must be enacted that require the proactive release of\ninformation of pollutant discharge, stored and transfered information. Creating mandatory\nenvironmental information disclosure programs such as pollutant release transfer registers are a\npriority for the region. Pollution data should be linked to government enforcement, and in\naddition it should communicate risk to public health and the environment. Where companies\nproactively disclosed pollutant discharge information this can strengthen corporate social responsibility.\nFurther info, click here\n Posted by: Movanet \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2013-07-foi-commission-needs-strengthening.html":{"slug":"blog/2013-07-foi-commission-needs-strengthening.html","filePath":"blog/2013-07-foi-commission-needs-strengthening.html.md","title":"FoI commission needs strengthening  | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"FoI commission needs strengthening\nSaturday, July 27, 2013   Unknown \n\nMohamad Mova Al’Afghani, Bogor, West Java | Opinion (The Jakarta Post) | Tue, July 16 2013\nThe House of Representatives has elected seven members to the National Freedom of Information (FoI) Commission who will serve for the next four years.\nThe role of the commission is crucial in the reform process as it is mandated by the Freedom of Information Law No. 14/2008 to preside over disputes between the public and public bodies concerning access to information.\nAfter four years, what have we learned so far from the commission?\nFirst of all, the commission still lacks structural independence. Although Law No. 14/2008 stipulates that the commission is an “independent” body, it financially relies on the Communications and Information Ministry. In practice, the commission is a “task force” under the ministry, because it can only propose a budget through the\nMinistry’s secretariat-general.\nWorse, the commission has no liberty to appoint and recruit its own administrative officers. The commission staff members are employees of the ministry. These disadvantages will adversely impact on the performance of the commission’s employees.\nIn regulation theories, budgetary and employment issues are the two key determinants of independence. A regulatory body is said to be truly independent from the executive if its budget and human resources administration are not dependent on executive entities.\nThe rationale for promoting the commission’s independence is because it hears disputes between the public and the government.\nThus, the commission is expected to be neutral, fair and able to resist any pressure from the government side. But due to the lack of independence on budgetary and employment matters, the commission is prone to influence and pressure from the executive.\nThe pressure may not be in the form of repression, but snail-paced approval of budgets or limited manpower support. The issue of independence is becoming more important with the 2014 elections drawing near. It is very likely that public requests for information related to political parties’ budget and election disputes will rise.\nSecond, there is a need to uphold the personal integrity of the FoI commissioners. The commission has enacted a “code of ethics” but it short stops of regulating conflicts of interest. In advanced jurisdictions, conflicts of interest are not only regulated but also made transparent.\nIndependent bodies in advanced jurisdictions publish a register of their members’ past, present and potential conflicts of interest and include a list of past employment, political-party affiliation, share ownership, directorship and\nconsulting projects.\nThis register of interest is then published on the institution’s website. This sort of transparency mechanism will prevent conflicts of interest from occurring as disputants will know beforehand and can raise objections to the composition of a dispute panel.\nThird, there has to be value for money in bureaucracy. We need to be constantly reminded that transparency comes at a price despite the benefits it provides. FoI in the UK costs around £35.5 million (US53.4) per year (2005) while in the US it costs US382 million per year (2009). Such expenditure includes both the cost of compliance by public bodies and the operational cost of the FoI commission.\nJust as the efficiency of courts is evaluated, a FoI commission can be evaluated in terms of its case-handling. The part of the case-flow where adjudication and deliberation takes places is not a subject for evaluation since judges and arbitrators can take a long time to deliberate a single case and the length of deliberation is oftentimes not an indication of a measure of justice.\nNevertheless, this can still be used as an indicator or an estimate of efficiency in case handling.\nHowever, the genuinely administrative part of a dispute-settlement body can always be subjected to efficiency scrutiny.\nThis includes, among other things, the process of filing or case registration, notifications to disputants, determination of panel members and inter-institutional cooperation for execution. A justice system can be said to be efficient if these administrative processes are not time consuming.\nIt is possible to benchmark and rate quasi-judicial bodies such as the FoI commission (including the election commission, or the competition commission in this respect) in terms of their administrative efficiency. We can then see — on average — how much time is required by each of these commissions for each case, notwithstanding the complexity and differences in the nature of the disputes settled by them.\nFourth and finally, there is a need to enhance the quality of decisions or recommendations rendered by the commission.\nWhile dispute resolution is the primary duty of the commission, promotion and other forms of public relations activities are only secondary to this. One essential skill imperative for the fulfillment of this core duty is the skill of case analysis and writing judgments.\nFoI commissioners must have strong analytical abilities and be conversant in the art of legal hermeneutics. They must be able to interpret abstract legal notions such as “the public interest” in concrete cases. Such skills are not easy because case-law has not really developed in our legal system.\nThus, the commissioner may not find a lot on “public interest” through case-law and as a consequence they may be required to develop their own interpretations.\nWhat is important for a commissioner is not to render politically correct judgments, such as those that are in favor of transparency merely because it is more popular in civil society. What needs to be done is to arrive at the right and just decision.\nWhen internal capacity is lacking, a FoI commissioner should then hire experts in order to carry out the research in difficult cases in which precedence is lacking. There is a developing discipline of “comparative FoI” which looks at the norms, policies and practices of FoI in other jurisdictions that could be used as an approach to settle difficult cases.\nThe writer is a member of the Indonesian FoI Network.

Paper saya yang berjudul “The State Retreats and Never Returns: Consequences of Neoliberal Reforms on Administrative Law Protection in Indonesia” beserta presentasinya dapat di download di link tersebut.\n_\n_\nPada intinya tulisan saya membahas mengenai fenomena “negara mundur” dan penolakan terhadap “negara regulasi” di Indonesia. Baik fenomena negara mundur dan diskursus perihal “negara regulasi” sebenarnya belum begitu populer di Indonesia, walaupun pada kenyataannya, gejala tersebut ditemukan dalam kehidupan sehari-hari.\n_\n_\nSaya membandingkan fenomena mundurnya negara di Indonesia dengan di beberapa negara industri maju, terutama di eropah. Di eropah, negara mundur dan kemudian kembali lagi sebagai regulator, yang mana perannya tidak lagi memberikan pelayanan publik, melainkan sebagai regulator atas pelayanan publik yang diberikan oleh pihak bukan negara (non state actors). Nah, di Indonesia, menurut analisa dan beberapa studi kasus yang saya lakukan, negara juga mundur, namun tidak kembali lagi sebagai regulator. Sebagai konsekuensinya, maka beberapa perlindungan hukum administrasi negara yang tadinya tersedia bagi warga negara, menjadi tidak tersedia. Saya memberikan beberapa studi kasus: Privatisasi Air di Batam, Penerapan UU Keterbukaan Informasi Publik pada Konsesi Air di Jakarta dan terakhir, Keterbatasan UU Pelayanan Publik.\n_\n_\nAda dua penjelasan yang saya tawarkan. Pertama, penolakan Negara Regulasi pada tingkatan Mahkamah Konstitusi — karena pengaruh beberapa Jurist yang mendukung negara kesejahteraan seperti Wolfgang Friedmann — dan di sisi lain, delegasi/privatisasi terselubung kepada aktor bukan negara, yakni privatisasi yang dilakukan bukan dengan metode “full divestiture” atau penjualan saham atau aset, melainkan lewat kontrak dan mekanisme lainnya. Ironisnya, gerakan menolak privatisasi menurut saya, justru mengakibatkan regulasi tidak berkembang dan perlindungan hukum administrasi menjadi hilang.\n_\n_\nPenjelasan kedua adalah gerakan tata kelola pemerintahan (Good Governance), yang hanya menitik beratkan akuntabilitas pada fungsi tradisional negara, sementara fungsi-fungsi tersebut sebenarnya sudah didelegasikan kepada aktor bukan negara. Trend ini, misalnya lewat UU Keterbukaan Informasi Publik atau UU Pelayanan Publik memang cukup efektif dalam membuat negara akuntabel, tapi tidak efektif atau tidak berguna pada fungsi-fungsi yang didelegasikan.\n_\n_\nDalam konferensi saya bertemu banyak delegasi dari negara lain yang memberikan penjelasan menarik atas pelayanan publik di negaranya masing masing. Saya mendapatkan banyak kasus menarik mengenai pemberdayaan Perusahaan Milik Negara/BUMN di Malaysia (Kesehatan), Uruguay (Telekom) dan juga pemberdayaan sektor informal di India dan beberapa negara lainnya.\n Posted by: Unknown \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2014-04-the-free-flow-principles-from-article-19.html":{"slug":"blog/2014-04-the-free-flow-principles-from-article-19.html","filePath":"blog/2014-04-the-free-flow-principles-from-article-19.html.md","title":"The Free Flow Principles from Article 19 | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":["assets/pdfs/asset_00080_Right-to-Water-WEB.pdf"],"tags":["water-»"],"content":"water »\nThe Free Flow Principles from Article 19\nSunday, April 6, 2014   Unknown \nI was invited for an expert meeting in London by Article 19 last February, to discuss transparency principles applicable to water resources and services. The meeting provides input to the Free Flow Principles launched by Article 19 on the eve of the World Water Day.\n\nBelow are quotes from several experts and activists invited to the meeting:\nAmadou Kanoute, CICODEV, Senegal:\n“ Two years ago we heard through the media about the government’s plan to overhaul the institutional framework of the water delivery service in Senegal. The planned move from a service contract to a 25-year concession to a private company, would have meant a 41% increase on the tariff of water and would have made it difficult for disadvantaged consumers to access such an essential service. Just having that information and then being able to expose it pushed the government to revert. But what could have happened in Senegal has already taken place in many other countries in Africa, without notice and without people being given the opportunity to air their views. In our case we were lucky to have a free press to alert us.  The Free Flow Principles – specifying obligations of states in regard to right to know, right to be heard, right to speak, public participation and transparency – will be useful to all advocacy efforts on rights to water and sanitation.”\nVanessa Lucena Empinotti, Environmental Governance Research Group at PROCAM/IEE/University of São Paulo, Brazil:\n“ The Free Flow Principles will be instrumental in increasing transparency practices and access to information in the field of water resources. Particularly in Brazil, The Principles will reinforce the participatory and decentralized water institutions already in place and consequently increase their influence over the State and private sector. Access to information is critical to ensuring equitable access to water and sanitation.”\nRezaul Karim Chowdhury, Coast Trust, Bangladesh:\n“ In Bangladesh, we are in the midst of a drinking water crisis in both coastal and urban areas, mostly due to climate change. The situation is particularly critical for women who, in carrying the burden of providing for their families, are the worst to suffer. These Principles will be an invaluable tool for communities and civil society activists advocating for better governance.”****\nMohamad Mova Al’Afghani, Center for Water Governance, Indonesia:\n“ In Indonesia, disclosure in water and sanitation sector is minimal. Contracts are often kept secret and water governance tends to be implemented in a highly technical, exclusive and elitist manner. Problems relating to water are not simply about pipes and infrastructures. They are about how people resolve disputes amongst themselves and how they are able to relate themselves to the environment. If water democracy is to be realized, the public must be enabled to participate meaningfully in the process. The Principles will help empower people to do so.”\nScott Griffen, International Press Institute, Austria:\n“These Principles reflect an increasing recognition of the link between development and freedom of expression. By assisting journalists to define those rights and seek to improve and promote journalistic coverage of development issues, The Principles will very much compliment our efforts to guide journalists in their reporting of development issues. We look forward to distributing The Free Flow Principles to our network.”\nYou can download the full principles here (English).\nMohamad Mova Al’Afghani\n Posted by: Unknown \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2014-08-47-action-plans-have-been-released-for.html":{"slug":"blog/2014-08-47-action-plans-have-been-released-for.html","filePath":"blog/2014-08-47-action-plans-have-been-released-for.html.md","title":"47 ACTION PLANS HAVE BEEN RELEASED FOR 2014-2015 (47 RENCANA AKSI TELAH DIRILIS UNTUK PERIODE 2014-2015) | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":[],"tags":["governance-»","ogp-»","transparency-»"],"content":"governance », ogp », transparency »\n47 ACTION PLANS HAVE BEEN RELEASED FOR 2014-2015 (47 RENCANA AKSI TELAH DIRILIS UNTUK PERIODE 2014-2015)\nThursday, August 7, 2014   Unknown \nIndonesia has released the 3rd Action Plan for 2014-2015.

The data controller had intended to identify Wi-Fi networks and map their approximate location using _the vehicle’s GPS co-ordinates when the radio signal was received._The aim was to improve the geographic location database for location-based mobile applications.”\nKemudian, ICO memerintahkan berdasarkan Data Protection Act UK:\n“In view of the matters referred to above the Commissioner hereby gives notice that, in exercise of his powers under section 40 of the Act, he requires that:\n(1) Within 35 days of the date of this notice the data controller shall securely destroy any personal data within the meaning of the Data Protection Act 1998 held on vehicle discs and collected in the UK using Street View vehicles (to the extent that the data controller has no other legal obligations to retain such data) and,\n(2) If the data controller subsequently discovers a Street View vehicle disk holding personal data and collected in the UK it shall promptly inform the Information Commissioner. ”\nMasalahnya, Indonesia belum memiliki UU perlindungan hak privasi. Dengan demikian, masyarakat Indonesia akan lebih rentan dilanggar hak privasinya ketimbang masyarakat Uni Eropa yang dilindungi oleh Data Protection Directive. Memang, dalam UU Keterbukaan Informasi Publik terdapat pengecualian pembukaan informasi pribadi dan terdapat pula sanksi apabila membuka informasi pribadi. Namun penegakan dari sanksi ini masih belum jelas.\nPermasalahan lain adalah, kita tidak pernah mengetahui data apa saja yang dikumpulkan oleh Google. Gambar-gambar jalan dan rumah adalah data yang kelihatan, sementara sinyal wifi adalah data yang tidak kelihatan. Maka dari sisi Google sendiri diperlukan transparansi, berapa payload data yang dikumpulkan dan apa saja klasifikasinya.\nTidak semua permasalahan privasi harus maju ke kepolisian lewat jalur pidana atau ke pengadilan lewat jalur perdata. Seperti di Inggris, permasalahan regulasi informasi seharusnya cukup diselesaikan lewat regulator yang kompeten. Karena (i) kebutuhan privasi mendesak, (i) sebenarnya sudah ada sedikit pengaturan di UU KIP dan (iii) Komisi Informasi Pusat sudah beroperasi beberapa lama, menarik untuk dikaji apakah kompetensi Komisi sebaiknya diperluas dalam menangani kasus kasus privasi.\nCara untuk lapor ke Google\n**\n**\nKalau rumah anda, pelat mobil anda atau wajah anda masuk Google Street View, anda bisa lapor ke Google untuk minta dikaburkan gambarnya. Caranya, masuk ke Google Street View di dekat gambar yang ingin dilaporkan, kemudian click  report a problem. Dari situ anda akan dihadapkan pada beberapa formulir untuk melaporkan keberatan anda.\nBiasanya setelah launching, dalam waktu dekat, akan ada banyak koleksi gambar-gambar Street View yang pribadi sifatnya. Setidaknya anda cek dulu apakah rumah anda masuk didalamnya.\nMohamad Mova Al’Afghani\nCRPG\n Posted by: Unknown \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2014-09-our-cyborg-future-law-and-policy.html":{"slug":"blog/2014-09-our-cyborg-future-law-and-policy.html","filePath":"blog/2014-09-our-cyborg-future-law-and-policy.html.md","title":"Our Cyborg Future: Law and Policy Implications | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":["assets/asset_00077_13-132_8l9c.pdf"],"tags":[],"content":"Our Cyborg Future: Law and Policy Implications\nTuesday, September 9, 2014   Unknown \n\nMungkin ada yang tertarik dengan legal futurism? Laporan dari Brookings institute ini menarik sekali untuk disimak. Laporan ini bermula dari putusan penting (landmark decision) dari MA Amerika Serikat dalam kasus Riley v California. Dalam kasus tersebut, SCOTUS memutuskan bahwa melakukan penggeledahan pada telepon selular tanpa dilengkapi surat perintah adalah tidak konstitusional.\nLalu, apa hubungannya dengan Cyborg? Dalam kasus tersebut, salah satu hakim SCOTUS berpendapat:\n“These cases require us to decide how the search incident to arrest doctrine applies to modern cell phones, which are now such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life that the proverbial visitor from Mars might conclude they** were an important feature of human anatomy**.”\nNah, pengertian dari Cyborg adalah:\n1. a person whose physiological functioning is aided by or dependent upon a mechanical or electronic device;\n_\n_\n2. a person whose physical tolerances or capabilities are extended beyond normal human limitations by a machine or other external agency that modifies the body’s functioning; an integrated man–machine system.\nMaka ketika SCOTUS menyebut demikian (entah sengaja atau tidak), metafor Cyborg timbul ke permukaan. Intinya, SCOTUS seperti mengakui adanya integrasi antara manusia dengan mesin — dalam hal ini telepon seluler — dan bahwa handphone — dalam bahasa mereka “…are not just another technological convenience ” — tapi bagian dari manusia yang layak pula diberikan perlindungan dan privasi.\nMasalah integrasi manusia-mesin ini, dan kemudian, kesulitan untuk membedakan mana yang manusia dan mana yang sekedar mesin, merupakan objek studi dari Wittes dan Chong.\nDi kalangan Transhuman, diskusi soal Cyborg dan AI serta implikasi politik, kebijakan dan hukumnya sudah lama ramai diperbincangkan. Ada yang mendukung, seperti Hughes dan ada juga yang menolak, seperti Fukuyama (Artikel di FP dan Buku).\nArgumen Fukuyama lumayan solid. Cyborg, apalagi intelligence amplification, akan membuat manusia menjadi timpang. Ada yang sangat maju (lebih cepat dan kuat — misalnya menggunakan eksoskeleton atau lebih pintar dengan amplifikasi dan ada yang terbelakang). Hal ini akan merusak demokrasi.\nTapi, beberapa pakar seperti Hughes menyatakan bahwa manusia harus diberikan kebebasan atas dirinya, termasuk untuk menjadi post human — sebuah posisi yang sebenarnya libertarian. Salah satu justifikasi terkuat atas transhumanisme datang dari Bostrom.\nMohamad Mova Al’Afghani, PhD\n\n Posted by: Unknown \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2014-12-air-asia-qz-8501-berapa-jumlah-ganti.html":{"slug":"blog/2014-12-air-asia-qz-8501-berapa-jumlah-ganti.html","filePath":"blog/2014-12-air-asia-qz-8501-berapa-jumlah-ganti.html.md","title":"Air Asia QZ 8501: Berapa jumlah ganti rugi di Konvensi Montreal?  | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Air Asia QZ 8501: Berapa jumlah ganti rugi di Konvensi Montreal?\nSunday, December 28, 2014   Unknown \nDalam Konvensi Montreal 1999 (MC 99) dinyatakan:\nArticle 21 - Compensation in case of death or injury of passengers\n1.

Sebenarnya ini bukan hal yang baru. Beberapa pakar seperti David Bainbridge dan Richard Susskind sudah membayangkan sebuah sistem pakar untuk menggantikan peran lawyers.\n\nYang paling kontroversial tentu dari Susskind, dimana beberapa tahun lalu dia memprediksi bahwa di masa depan akan tersisa beberapa tipe lawyers: expert trusted adviser, enhanced practitioner, legal knowledge engineer, legal risk manager, dan legal hybrid. Legal knowledge engineer ini posisi yang menarik menurut saya, karena pekerjaannya adalah membuat packaging dan model penyelesaian.\nSalah satu ide yang dilontarkan di Inggris adalah membuat model bantuan hukum seperti NHS Direct. Seperti diketahui, NHS Direct adalah portal kesehatan di Inggris yang bebas digunakan penduduknya. Portal ini bisa diakses lewat telepon maupun online dan juga menyediakan symptomps checker untuk mengecek gejala. Portalnya sendiri ditutup tahun 2013, tetapi sistemnya yang di Wales dan symptomp checkernya masih berjalan.\nSementara itu di Kanada sedang hangat didiskusikan mengenai Alternative Business Structure (ABS) dari layanan hukum — diantaranya untuk mengatasi berbagai kepakaran diluar hukum yang beririsan ke pelayanan hukum. Ada 3 model yang diusulkan:\n\n\nModel #1 Business entities providing legal services only in which individuals and entities who are not licensed by the Law Society can have up to 49 per cent ownership.\nModel #2: Business entities providing legal services only with no restrictions on ownership by individuals and entities who are not licensed by the Law Society.\nModel #3 Business entities providing both legal and non-legal services (except those identified as posing a regulatory risk) in which individuals and entities who are not licensed by the Law Society would be permitted up to 49 per cent ownership.\n\n\nKembali ke soal due dilligence, apakah mungkin tahun 2030 diserahkan ke software? Yang saya tahu persis (dan juga gunakan) adalah bahwa software sistem manajemen dokumen saat ini sudah semakin baik. Dilengkapi dengan Optical Character Recognition yang sudah sangat efektif, ketelitian dan kecepatan software ini sangat bisa mengalahkan mata manusia.\nDisamping itu, dalam birokrasi juga terjadi berbagai penataan. Pemerintah memulai gerakan Sistem Informasi Perizinan (SIP) — yang dulu ada di UKP4 dan sekarang masih berjalan walaupun UKP4 sudah tidak beroperasi. Sisminbakum juga memiliki potensi untuk bisa updating status AD/ART PT terakhir, real-time. Demikian juga, di pertanahan, BPN sudah membuat portal (masih sederhana sih) untuk layanan pertanahan (silahkan coba sendiri). Sementara itu, beberapa pengadilan (termasuk MA) sudah mempublikasikan register perkaranya online. Selain itu, sekarang ini di beberapa negara termasuk Indonesia juga sudah menjadi anggota Open Government Partnership (OGP) yang salah satu normanya adalah teknologi an inovasi untuk keterbukaan dan akuntabilitas.\nKeseluruhan dokumen diatas merupakan bagian standar dari kegiatan due dilligence atau uji tuntas. Apabila beberapa tahun lagi layanan-layanan tersebut bisa disediakan online secara akurat, maka tidak perlu lagi menggunakan manusia untuk mengecek satu persatu. Jadi, mungkin sekali — setidaknya untuk due dilligence — bahwa peran lawyer digantikan oleh software di masa depan. Tidak perlu artificial intelligence, cukup software yang terintegrasi dengan layanan yang sudah ada.\n Posted by: Unknown \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2015-01-ceo-water-mandate-rtws-guidance.html":{"slug":"blog/2015-01-ceo-water-mandate-rtws-guidance.html","filePath":"blog/2015-01-ceo-water-mandate-rtws-guidance.html.md","title":"CEO water mandate RTWS Guidance  | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"CEO water mandate RTWS Guidance\nMonday, January 19, 2015   Unknown \nUN-Water’s 2015 Annual International Zaragoza Conference on “Water and Sustainable Development: From Vision to Action” launched a comprehensive guideline on right to water and sanitation.

One of the main obstacles in intervening in the development of community-based water and sanitation (Air Minum Penyehatan Lingkungan Berbasis Masyarakat or AMPL-BM) are due to regional autonomy.\nAccording to our sources, provinces can no longer intervene in the development of community-based watsan in regencies/municipalities, since their authority in water provisions are limited to inter-municipality/inter-regencies initiatives or in areas regarded as “water scarce”. Indeed, regional autonomy principles bars provinces from interfering in local (regency/municipality) affairs. Water provision is considered as local affairs. On the other hand, almost all of community-based watsan initiatives are conducted at local level.\nOur sources told that Law 23 is quite strict in terms of restricting provincial involvement into inter regency/municipality initiatives whereas Government Regulation 38 provides permit some intervention for water scarce areas. For now, provincial governments can intervene through “belanja hibah” (provincial grants). However, this scheme is not entirely secure. The Ministry of Interior have conducted review of the province’s regional budget and conclude that such grants mechanism is incompatible with regional autonomy principles.\nWe will conduct a legal analysis of regional autonomy laws and recommend feasible solution to this problem.\n Posted by: Unknown \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2015-01-the-relationship-between-community.html":{"slug":"blog/2015-01-the-relationship-between-community.html","filePath":"blog/2015-01-the-relationship-between-community.html.md","title":"The relationship between community based water services and regional water utility | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":[],"tags":["community-»","water-»"],"content":"community », water »\nThe relationship between community based water services and regional water utility\nTuesday, January 13, 2015   Unknown \nOne of the aspects we examine in our Indii-AIIRA research on the regulatory framework for community based water services is the relationship between local water utilities in CBO.\nAs we all know, the National Policy on Community Based Drinking Water and Environmental Health (Kebijakan Nasional AMPL BM) differentiates between community based versus non community based (the policy uses the term community versus “institution based” services. “Institution based” services includes PDAM. Our research looks at how these regimes interact.\nOne of the dominant view we observe in our research is that CB WS is perceived as a voluntary effort. CB initiatives are perceived as inherently temporary, until PDAM can expand its network to remote areas. We discovered cases where PDAM actually expands to regions where CBs are already present.\nSome of the issues that we encounter are the following:\n1. Health PDAMs can oftentimes provides water reliable quantity and quality and have the capacity to expand network to remote areas served by CB.\n2. Villagers may opt for PDAM services, provided that they can ensure quality abd quantity as above, rather than CB services, if they have both the willingness and capability to pay.\n3. However, PDAM services costs more than CB services, due to various treatment, technology and expertise employed there. Consumer may choose lower water quality provided by CB over PDAM. This is case where consumer preference prevails.\n4. In times of drought, water sources used by CB depletes. Healthy PDAMs can be more reliable in terms of securing water supply as they have the technology and resources to treat surface water, whereas, most CB uses groundwater. In these cases, consumer preference plays no role. Consumer may tend to choose to switch to PDAM from CB.\n5. The coordination between PDAM, CB and other initiatives are crucial. This must be reflected in RISPAM (water plan) and informally in day to day activities.\n Posted by: Unknown \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2015-02-higher-minimum-wage-is-in-fact.html":{"slug":"blog/2015-02-higher-minimum-wage-is-in-fact.html","filePath":"blog/2015-02-higher-minimum-wage-is-in-fact.html.md","title":"Higher minimum wage is (in fact) a capitalist instrument | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Higher minimum wage is (in fact) a capitalist instrument\nSaturday, February 28, 2015   Unknown \nA capitalist instrument for preventing revolution — that is.

The post made special reference to Special Accountability Report which is piloted by Indonesia OGP IRM:\n\n\nAbout the Indonesia Special Accountability Report\n\n\n\nMost of the countries whose reports are being released today began their OGP participation in 2013. Indonesia, a founding country of OGP, is an exception, having participated since 2011. So why is there a report on Indonesia being released for public comment today?\nThe first Indonesia action plan covered 2011 to the end of 2012. The second action plan covered all of 2013. This is the action plan evaluated in today’s draft “Special Accountability Report.” The government of Indonesia also released a third action plan in 2014 that runs until 2015. That action plan will receive a typical progress report after the one-year mark, similar to other countries in the same calendar as Indonesia. That report is due for public comment in July of this year.\nThe IRM takes its role as promoting learning and accountability seriously. For that reason, to the greatest extent possible, all OGP commitments will be tracked and accounted for. The Special Accountability report represents an important step in that direction.\n\n\n\nPreviously, CRPG announced a public comment period for the 2013 OGP IRM Report.\n Posted by: Unknown \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2015-02-regulation-of-community-based-water-and.html":{"slug":"blog/2015-02-regulation-of-community-based-water-and.html","filePath":"blog/2015-02-regulation-of-community-based-water-and.html.md","title":"Regulation of Community Based Water and Sanitation (January Review) | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":[],"tags":["community-»","water-»"],"content":"community », water »\nRegulation of Community Based Water and Sanitation (January Review)\nSunday, February 1, 2015   Unknown \nThe following is a review of blog posts on the regulation of community based water and sanitation in Indonesia to date.

Kebijakan domestik yang dilakukan oleh presiden Jokowi kerap kali dipandang pesimis, kepemimpinannya dianggap membawa kemunduran dalam arena domestik. __ Kondisi ini ditambah dengan strategi komunikasi politik yang monoton dan polos dalam mempertahankan kebijakannya. Langkah politiknya dalam menghadapi serangan rival-rival politik \\menunjukan Joko Widodo bukanlah sosok politisi yang matang. Maka, protes dan keluhan atas kepemimpinannya beredar secara massif di media sosial. Demonstrasi mulai marak muncul untuk menuntut administrasi pemerintahannya. Ada semacam penyesalan terhadap kepemimpinan Jokowi. Setidaknya, ada tiga peristiwa yang menyebabkan kebijakan domestik rezim Jokowi menuai protes dari publik.\nPertama, sikap Jokowi yang dianggap ragu ragu dalam serial krisis-KPK yang berkepanjangan, keputusan Jokowi untuk menonaktifkan sejumlah pimpinan KPK dipersepsikan oleh publik sebagai pembiaran atas kegiatan delegitimasi dan “pelemahan” institusi KPK yang tengah berlangsung. Keputusan Jokowi ini dianggap blunder khususnya bagi kelas menengah Indonesia yang menjadikan KPK sebagai institusi trustable sebagai respon atas krisis kepercayaan terhadap lembaga-lembaga Negara.\nKedua,Pilihan Rezim Jokowi untuk membuat kebijakan yang tidak populer yakni menaikan harga BBM, juga menaikan tarif terhadap barang komoditi dan jasa yang dianggap merugikan bagi kepentingan kelas menengah, seperti tarif dasar listrik, kereta api. Keputusan ini dengan cepat menjadikan Jokowi sebagai “musuh baru” kelas menengah.\nKetiga,konsolidasi internal pemerintahan Jokowi terganggu karena dibayangi oleh upaya intervensi kekuatan politik tertentu yang menjadi penyokong politik Jokowi. Wacana Jokowi sebagai pemimpin cum petugas partai dipandang sinis oleh masyarakat kelas menengah,kepemimpinan Jokowi dipersepsikan lemah, mudah untuk dikendalikan serta tidak berwibawa.__\n_\n_Hambatan Oligarkhi politik __\n__\nBoleh jadi, protes dan kritik yang disampaikan oleh publik tersebut relatif benar bahwa kita mengalamikemunduran selangkah dalam upaya pemberantasan anti korupsi. Selama enam bulan publik seolah-olah menyaksikan kepemimpinan Joko Widodo yang penuh dilematis. Walaupun demikian, baik kiranya kita memahami secara jernih adil dan jujur dalam menilai kenyataan yang dihadapi oleh administrasi pemerintahan Jokowi.\nSebagai figur politik baru kekuasaan politik Jokowi tidak utuh, dia harus berhadapan dengan klik oligarkhi politik yang sudah asam garam mengenggam arena politik nasional selama 17 tahun. Maka, konsolidasi internal pemerintahan jokowi yang lambat dapat kita pahami sebagai proses pertarungan dengan oligarkhi politik, tentu saja tidak mudah bagi Jokowi melakukan konsolidasi pemerintahan tanpa gangguan kepentingan oligarkhi politik.\nKonsekuensi lain atas peran oligarkhi politik dalam proses politik khas Indonesia yang kuat, menjadikan Jokowi dengan kekuatan dan jaringan politik terbatas,menuai hambatan untuk mewujudkan reformasi secara cepat dan massif. Serial krisis KPK yang hadir sejak dua tahun yang lalu menunjukan betapa rapuhnya agenda anti korupsi terhadap intervensi kaum oligarch, kemajuan-kemajuan penegakan anti korupsi masih bersifat artifisial, belum menyentuh akar masalah utama. Berdasarkan pengalaman tersebut, agenda anti korupsi tidak dapat dilaksanakan melalui cara cara instan, ada proses yang harus dilalui,butuh komitmen dukungan jaringan politik yang kuat. Maka keputusan untuk “mundur selangkah” agar melompat ke depan adalah jalan yang arif,realistis untuk dilaksanakan. __\n_\n_Pemimpin yang bekerja\nDalam sisi lain kita harus jujur akan kebijakan-kebijakan Jokowi yang cemerlang, rencana proyek-proyek infrastruktur berupa pembangunan jalan,pelabuhan maupun jalur kereta memberikan sebuah harapan baru, penyediaan lapangan kerja serta prospek jangka panjang gerak-roda ekonomi riil yang baik. Pembangunan infrastruktur juga sebuah pembuktian nyata bahwa anggaran tahunan negara kita tidak hanya sekedar dihabiskan dalam alokasi konsumsi serta “subsidi” semata, tetapi dalam bentuk konkrit, sesuatu yang dapat kita wariskan pada generasi anak cucu kita.\nPelaksanaan tol laut yang mulai beroperasi adalah bukti kesungguhannya untuk membenahi jalur distribusi barang dan jasa dan interkoneksitas pulau-pulau di Nusantara, sesuatu yang selalu menjadi masalah klasik bagi percepatan pembangunan di Indonesia. Pembangunan kawasan Indonesia timur bukan lagi janji-janji surgawi yang didengungkan untuk menutupi ketimpangan sosial,beragam komitmen investasi dari pembangunan pabrik semen hingga pengembangan kawasan wisata terpadu siap untuk direalisasikan.\nKomitmen untuk menciptakan pembangunan dari wilayah pinggiran diwujudkan dalam pembangunan desa yang mendapatkan perhatian secara serius, rambu rambu regulasi untuk pembangunan desa mandiri telah disusun, penguatan lembaga Badan Usaha Milik Desa memberikan harapan baru sebagai penggerak ekonomi desa yang mandiri.\nHarus diakui, Jokowi adalah satu-satunya presiden dalam era reformasi yang secara tegas merealisasikan pembubaran PETRAL sebagai bukti komitmennya dalam upaya mewujudkan tata kelola migas yang baru dan transparan. Pembubaran PETRAL yang disertai dengan aktivasi integrated supply chained disinyalir dapat menghemat dana hingga 250 Milyar per hari.\nDalam bidang luar negeri, kebijakannya yang mengusahakan peran strategis Indonesia di kancah internasional sebagai poros maritim dunia menandai era baru politik luar negeri yang impresif dan bermartabat. Harus diakui, Joko Widodo adalah satu-satunya Presiden Indonesia dalam era reformasi yang berkenan bersikap terbuka dalam forum resmi internasional.

Misalnya, dalam Putusan yang membatalkan Undang Undang Sumber Daya Air, Mahkamah merujuk pada United Nations Convention On The Law of The Sea atau Konvensi PBB tentang Hukum Laut.[7] Padahal, seperti sebelumnya dijelaskan, ketika kita membahas Sumber Daya Air, kita sedang membahas air tawar yang hanya 0,77% (nol koma tujuh puluh tujuh persen) itu. Sedangkan UNCLOS membahas air laut.\nKarena kurangnya pemahaman ini pula, akhir akhir ini berkembang pemahaman bahwa agar dikuasai negara, rezim air hasrunya merupakan rezim pengelolaan (beheersdaad) yang mana Badan Usaha Milik Negara atau Daerah mengelolanya. Paradigma ini tidak sepenuhnya tepat, sebab air bukanlah minyak. Minyak dapat dikuasai oleh perusahaan tunggal milik negara, karena biaya eksplorasi dan eksploitasi yang besar dan bendanya bukan bagian dari kebutuhan biologis manusia.\nSedangkan air dibutuhkan oleh manusia, hewan dan tumbuhan dalam kesehariannya. Tidak mungkin untuk menggali sumur perlu dilakukan oleh BUMN/BUMD. Justru sebaliknya, sebisa mungkin masyarakat harus bisa mengambil air dari lingkungan untuk kebutuhan sehari-hari, tanpa izin apapun.[8]\nPembatalan Undang Undang Sumber Daya Air, walaupun pahit, memaksa negara kita untuk mencari model pengelolaan air yang sesuai dengan ekonomi politik Indonesia.[9] Karena air sangat vital peranannya dalam berbagai aspek kehidupan, maka peraturan pengganti Undang-Undang Sumber Daya Air harus cepat diberlakukan. Dapat dibayangkan, apabila regulasi air tidak lekas tuntas, maka hampir seluruh sektor industri kecuali jasa akan terkena dampak langsung. Apalagi untuk dapat mengatasi krisis air dan sanitasi sebagaimana dibahas sebelumnya, kepastian hukum mutlak diperlukan.\nMenemukan model pengelolaan air yang sesuai dengan karakter Indonesia tidaklah mudah. Mahkamah Konstitusi ketika membatalkan Undang-Undang Sumber Daya Air karena alasan komersialisasi dan privatisasi[10], tidak secara gamblang merekomendasikan alternatif model pengelolaan air di Indonesia.\n\nDownload Paper.\n Posted by: Unknown \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2016-02-about-open-government-partnership-and.html":{"slug":"blog/2016-02-about-open-government-partnership-and.html","filePath":"blog/2016-02-about-open-government-partnership-and.html.md","title":"About Open Government Partnership and Independent Reporting Mechanism | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":[],"tags":["ogp-»","open-government-»","regulation-»","sharing-economy-»"],"content":"ogp », open government », regulation », sharing economy »\nAbout Open Government Partnership and Independent Reporting Mechanism\nThursday, February 18, 2016   Unknown \nBackground\nCorruption is one of the most serious problem that Indonesia currently have. To fight corruption, do citizen empowerment, and strengthening the governance is important to create a better country, to make a better life for all of the citizen. In order to achieve that, since 2011 Indonesia government partnered with Open Government Partnership (OGP), a voluntary international initiative that aims to secure commitments from governments to their citizenry to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance.\nOGP Process\nIndonesia as countries participating in OGP has to follow a process for consultation during the development of their action plan, and during implementation.\nIn this 2014-2015 period, Indonesia has reached its third national plan, where the scope has been expanded. There was even called SOLUSIMU, a contest where citizens could submit their ideas for improving public services for inclusion in the Action Plan, to make the betterment on the exclusivity-hole from the previous process on the previous period. However, the lack of advance notice, lack of evidence of consultation events, and lack of clarity on the incorporation of citizen-generated ideas in the action plan undermined the government’s increased public participation efforts.\nCore Team meetings served as the multi-stakeholder consultation forum. It is found that there still was very little meaningful consultation and collaboration between government and wider civil society on the commitment implementation. The Core Team meetings then focused on raising awareness of the OGP process, and increasing public participation especially through SOLUSIMU contest, but the team did not publicize or track progress on commitments.\nMethodological note\nIn Indonesia, The Independent Reporting Mechanism of OGP has partnered with Mohammad Mova Al’Afghani of Centre for Regulation, Policy, and Governance (CRPG), that carried out the evaluation of the development and implementation of this Indonesia’s third action plan. CRPG reviewed the government’s self-assesment report, gathered the views of civil society, and interviewed related government officials and stakeholders. After that, OGP staff and a panel of experts reviewed the report.\nCPRG reviewed three key documents prepared by the government: a report on Indonesia’s third action plan submitted to the OGP portal in 2014, the internal document detailing action plan commitments and milestones published in Bahasa Indonesian in April 2015, and the government self-assessment report (GSAR) published in April 2015.\nA stakeholder forum in FGD model was organized in Jakarta by The IRM researcher and Medialink, a civil society organization (CSO), in order to gather the opinion of multiple stakeholders.\nReport Coverage\nThis report covers the first year of implementation of Indonesia’s third action plan, 7 November 2014 through 31 July 2015. Beginning in 2015, the IRM also publishes end of term reports to account for the final status of progress at the end of the action plan’s two-year period. This report follows on two earlier reviews of OGP performance, “Indonesia Progress Report 2011-2013” and “Indonesia Special Accountability Report 2013.” These reports covered the development and implementation of the first action plan as well as the development and implementation of the second action plan from 1 January 2013 through 31 December 2013.\n**\n**\n Posted by: Unknown \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2016-02-anti-privatisation-debates-opaque-rules.html":{"slug":"blog/2016-02-anti-privatisation-debates-opaque-rules.html","filePath":"blog/2016-02-anti-privatisation-debates-opaque-rules.html.md","title":"Anti-Privatisation Debates, Opaque Rules and ‘Privatised’ Water Services Provision: Some Lessons from Indonesia | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Anti-Privatisation Debates, Opaque Rules and ‘Privatised’ Water Services Provision: Some Lessons from Indonesia\nMonday, February 15, 2016   Unknown \nThis was from a conference in IDS, Sussex, back in 2011, published in the IDS Bulletin in 2012.

PCBs have been widely used in the past, mainly in electronical equipments. The commercial production of PCBs started in 1929, but their use has been banned or restricted in many countries since the 1970s because of the possible risks to human health and environment.\nPCBs are generally very stable, and are resistant to acids and bases as well as to heat. They have been used as an insulating material in electric equipment, such as transformers and capacitors. PCBs have also been used in wide range of products such as plasticizers, surface coatings, inks, and carbonless duplicating paper.\nSince 1929 around 2 million tons of PCBs have been produced, and about 10% of which still remain today because of their stability.\nPCBs can persist in the environment and accumulate in animals and along the food-chain. Humans may be exposed to PCBs by ingesting contaminated food and water or inhaling contaminated air. In the human body PCBs can remain in fatty tissues and in the liver and may be transferred from mother to child through the placenta or breast milk. The speed at which PCBs are transformed in the body and the extent to which they are either stored or excreted depend on the type of PCB.\nStudies on humans and animals have shown harmful effects on fertility. Furthermore,of the child during pregnancy or through breast-feeding can affect its development. Effects on the immune system have been observed in animals, in children exposed to PCBs during development in the womb, and in adults exposed through PCB-contaminated food. Groups of workers that have been exposed to high levels of PCBs\nPCBs Regulations in Indonesia\n\nIn Indonesia, there is no regulations that specifically regulates PCBs. PCBs are categorized as hazardous and toxic substances (limbah B3). In general, the regulations can be found in Law No. 32/2009 about Environmental Protection Management, GR No. 74/2001 on Hazardous Toxic and Substance Management, GR No. 101/2014 on Hazardous Waste and Toxic Management.\nGap Analysis and Recommendations\nHowever, there still are many holes in the term of PCBs, such as :\n1. The existing regulations do not have clear definitions regarding articles and/or equipment containing/contaminated with PCBs as a hazardous materials.\n2. They do not have clear status regarding articles and/prg equipment containing/contaminated with PCBs, whether should it be treated as hazardous waste, prohibited to be imported, or hazardous materials, etc.\n3. There is no regulation that specifically prohibits, control, and regulate the distribution, and import of PCBs mixture, and equipment that containing/contaminated with PCBs to Indonesia, as GR No. 74/2001 only regulates about PCBs as chemicals.\n4. There has not been guideline standard (e.g SNI) on regarding PCBs treshold limit in the equipment/articles.\n5. The policy regarding to PCB management is not yet related with different sector and ministries\n6. Lastly, there has not been any policy regarding unintentional release of PCB to the environments.\nRegarding to those matters, we recommend :\n1. For government to issue regulations that specifically prohibits the import of PCB (as chemical substance);\n2.To clarify the status of articles and/or equipment containing/contaminated with PCBs. Whether should it be treated as hazardous waste, prohibited to be imported, etc.;\n3. To formulate standard regarding the PCBs threshold limit in equipment/articles (especially in the consumer products);\n4. To formulate a guideline regarding the environmentally sound management of PCBs (the technical one);\n5. To formulate policy and measures to reduce or eliminate PCBs releases from unintentional production;\n6. To discuss the role and function of B3 commission in this matter;\n7. To discuss whether there is a discretion for specific ministry to prohibit the import/use/distribution of new PoP’s subtance.\nReferences :\nInternal source\nWhat are PCBs, accessed from www.greenfacts.org/en/pcbs/l-2/1-polychlorinated-biphenyls.htm#0 on Feb 6th, 2016\n\n Posted by: Unknown \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2016-02-indonesia-ogp-irm-report-open-for.html":{"slug":"blog/2016-02-indonesia-ogp-irm-report-open-for.html","filePath":"blog/2016-02-indonesia-ogp-irm-report-open-for.html.md","title":"Indonesia OGP IRM Report Public Comment Period | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":["assets/pdfs/asset_00044_Indo_ProgressReport3_PubCommBahasa.pdf"],"tags":["ogp-»","open-government-»","regulation-»","sharing-economy-»"],"content":"ogp », open government », regulation », sharing economy »\nIndonesia OGP IRM Report Public Comment Period\nSaturday, February 13, 2016   Unknown \n\nThe Indonesian 2014 IRM Progress Report have been opened for Public Comment since January.\nAt a glance, Indonesia’s achievement with the Open Government is as follows:\n\nDownload the English version here and the Bahasa Indonesia version here.\n Posted by: Unknown \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2016-02-mengenal-bahaya-polychlorinated.html":{"slug":"blog/2016-02-mengenal-bahaya-polychlorinated.html","filePath":"blog/2016-02-mengenal-bahaya-polychlorinated.html.md","title":"Mengenal Bahaya Polychlorinated Biphenyls | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":["assets/asset_00051_envhper00521-0121.pdf"],"tags":["environment-»","polychlorinated-biphenyls-»","regulation-»"],"content":"environment », polychlorinated biphenyls », regulation »\nMengenal Bahaya Polychlorinated Biphenyls\nWednesday, February 24, 2016   Unknown \n\nPolychorinated Biphenyls (PCB) dapat menyebabkan kanker, kemandulan, penyakit cardiovaskular, gangguan sistem syaraf, gangguan endokrin, gangguan imunitas dan berbagai permasalahan kesehatan lainnya.

TSCA §6(e), 15 U.S.C. §2605(c).\nIn evaluating whether or not a risk is reasonable, USEPA considers the probability that a regulatory action will harm health or the environment, and the costs and benefits to society that are likely to result from the action. In other words, USEPA must protect against unreasonable risks from PCBs by providing cost-effective and environmentally protective options that reduce exposure to PCBs.\n\n Posted by: Unknown \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2016-02-sarahlerner-15.html":{"slug":"blog/2016-02-sarahlerner-15.html","filePath":"blog/2016-02-sarahlerner-15.html.md","title":"PCB Regulations in European Union | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":[],"tags":["environment-»","polychlorinated-biphenyls-»","regulation-»"],"content":"environment », polychlorinated biphenyls », regulation »\nPCB Regulations in European Union\nMonday, February 22, 2016   Unknown \nPCB’s have long been recognised as posing a threat to the environment because of their toxicity, persistence and tendency to bioaccumulate (i.e. to build up in the bodies of animals, particularly at the top of the food chain). Although the use of PCBs has been reduced greatly since the 1970s it is recognised that those still remaining in existing equipment pose a continuing environmental threat.\nIn European Union, about Polychlorinated Byphenils (PCBs) is regulated through EC Directive 96/59 EC on the disposal of PCBs and Polychlorinated Terphenils (PCTs), which requires the preparation of national inventories and the labelling/disposal of all PCB holdings.\nAlso there are European Communities (Dangerous Substances and Preparations)(Marketing and Use) Regulations 2003.[1] These regulations implement Council Directives 85/467/EEC and 89/677/EEC in relation to polychlorinated biphenyls (except mono and dichlorinated biphenyls), PCTs, and preparations, including waste oils, with a PCB or PCT weight content higher than 0.005%. These substances may not be used, except in designated applications that were in service prior to 30 June 1986. Equipment and plant containing PCBs or PCTs are required to display instructions concerning disposal and maintenance and use of equipment and plant containing them.\nMember states then implement this directive into their municipal laws and regulations.\nBelow are laws and regulations about PCBs in several member states of EU :\nUnited Kingdom\n1. The Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 requires employers to ensure so far as is reasonably practicable the health, safety and welfare of all their employees at work. You are required to co-operate with your employer, for example by using safety equipment and working methods as instructed.\n2. The Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 1994 (COSHH) place duties on employer to:\n· ensure that your exposure to PCBs is either prevented, or if this is not reasonably practicable, adequately controlled;\n· assess the risks to your health from PCBs and identify the measures which are needed to protect your health;\n· ensure that control measures are adequate and that you use them;\n· monitor your exposure;\n· provide you with information on the risks of PCBs and the steps which are necessary to protect your health.\nEmployer also have duties under COSHH to:\n· co-operate with your employer;\n· use protective measures and to report any defects.\n3. The Environmental Protection Act 1990 requires, amongst other things, waste holders to exercise a duty of care when disposing of certain materials.[2]\nIreland\nThe Waste Management (Hazardous Waste) Regulations 1998[3] of Ireland implement provisions of the EC Directive (96/59/EC) and sets out the requirements in terms of disposing of PCBs and registering holdings of PCBs. A holder of PCBs, used PCBs or contaminated equipment must:\n1. Decontaminate or dispose of used PCBs, contaminated equipment and the PCBs contained in such equipment as soon as possible. For contaminated equipment containing more than 5dm3 (5 litres) of PCBs:\n· By 31 December 2010, if the fluid content contains more than 0.05% by weight of PCBs.

Secara prinsip, apabila suatu kegiatan ekonomi dapat berjalan lancar dengan sendirinya tanpa merugikan orang lain dan lingkungan, tidak perlu ada regulasi.\nMeski demikian, apabila ada sedikit saja potensi pihak ketiga dan lingkungan dirugikan, di situ terdapat justifikasi untuk melakukan regulasi. Dalam kasus transportasi online seperti Uber dan Gojek, setidaknya ada beberapa pihak yang—apabila tidak terdapat regulasi yang memadai—dapat dirugikan. Pertama adalah sopir.\nKarena status hukumnya bukan sebagai pekerja, sopir tidak mendapat perlindungan dari hukum ketenagakerjaan berupa hak-hak jaminan kesehatan, jaminan sosial, dan sebagainya. Kedua adalah penumpang. Dalam transportasi umum berizin ada beberapa standar yang harus dipenuhi. Misalnya, harus ada yang memastikan tersedia seatbelt yang berfungsi atau remnya tidak blong.\nApabila tidak, ada potensi bahaya. Ketiga adalah lingkungan sekitar seperti pengguna jalan yang dapat dibahayakan akibat pengemudi yang ugal-ugalan dalam mencari setoran. Bagi para ekonom, istilah dari fenomena-fenomena ini adalah ”eksternalitas negatif”. Tiga hal di atas adalah contoh singkat justifikasi mengapa Uber dan GoJek seharusnya diregulasi.\nMungkin ada yang akan berpendapat bahwa soal standar keamanan sebenarnya sudah diatur dalam peraturan lalu lintas dan transportasi umum, mengapa untuk Uber dan GoJek harus diatur khusus? Betul bahwa ada standar umum yang berlaku bagi setiap kendaraan, namun Uber dan GoJek berbeda karena aset kendaraan dipergunakan khusus untuk keperluan nonpribadi.\nDi sini ada potensi ”moral hazard ” di mana standar keselamatan dikompromikan karena kepentingan finansial. Dengan kata lain, pemilik kendaraan pribadi akan lebih cenderung melakukan investasi terhadap keselamatan dibanding pemilik angkutan umum atau mobil yang diompreng -kan. Tapi, bukankah ada aturan tidak menjamin keselamatan, buktinya banyak juga angkutan umum yang terlibat kecelakaan dan sopirnya ugal-ugalan?\nBetul, tapi di sini kita bicara ”efektivitas regulasi”, sementara sebelumnya kita bicara soal ”justifikasi regulasi”. Moral hazard dan eksternalitas negatif merupakan dua justifikasi utama untuk melakukan regulasi. Adalah kewajiban pemerintah untuk memastikan ongkos sosial dari kegiatan ekonomi ini minimum dan terefleksikan dalam harga yang dibayar. Bukankah GoJek lebih bagus dari ojek pangkalan karena sudah pasti penumpang diberikan helm dan masker? Betul.\nNah, sekarang kita bicara soal efektivitas regulasi. Soal GoJek yang memberikan helm kepada penumpangnya sebenarnya merupakan sinyal bahwa Uber dan GoJek memiliki potensi untuk meregulasi dirinya sendiri (self regulation).\nSetiap kali berbicara regulasi, orang cenderung berpikir tentang aturan dan sanksi yang dikeluarkan pemerintah lewat peraturan perundangundangan. Ini sebenarnya kurang tepat karena pertanyaan kedua yang wajib dijawab ketika pertanyaan pertama tentang justifikasi regulasi sudah terjawab adalah dengan metode dan model apa regulasi akan dilakukan?\nModel regulasi aturan dan sanksi dari pemerintah itu dikenal dengan metode ”commandand- control”. Metode ini paling klasik karena berbicara otoritas negara. Mayoritas publikasi akademik terakhir dalam arena regulasi mengusulkan self regulation bagi sharing economy. Self regulation berbeda dengan commandandcontrol karena dalam self regulation ada ”ruang regulasi” bagi pelaku ekonomi.\nDalam self regulation, pemerintah tidak perlu mengawasi detail tetek bengek standar keselamatan secara langsung dan memberikan sanksi kepada pelanggarnya karena hal itu dilakukan sendiri oleh pelaku ekonomi. Kenapa self regulation banyak diusulkan sebagai metode regulasi sharing economy? Jawabannya adalah platform bisnis ini dengan mudahnya (dan dengan ongkos yang sangat minim) bisa mengeluarkan dan memasukkan orang ke dalam kegiatan ekonomi.\nRegulasi intinya adalah penentuan siapa yang boleh ikut serta dan siapa yang tidak serta standar apa yang dipakai untuk menentukan seseorang boleh ikut serta atau tidak. Uber dan GoJek punya standar untuk menentukan siapa yang bisa jadi sopir dan ikut ke dalammarketplace- nya. Apabila ada sopir yang ugal-ugalan, akan di-ban dari appnya dan di-blacklist sebagai sopir.\nStandarstandar ini ”regulasi” juga walaupun tunduk kepada ”terms ofservice ” dan bukan peraturan perundang-undangan di bidang transportasi. Metode kedua yang dipakai untuk self regulation dalam sharing economy adalah sistem reputasi. Sistem reputasi ini dulu terkenal ketika dipakai oleh Ebay untuk me-rating penjual. Penjual yang punya rating tinggi memperoleh reputasi yang baik dan dipercaya oleh konsumen.\nPada hakikatnya, sistem reputasi ini merefleksikan kualitas suatu barang (atau dalam kasus GoJek dan Uber, suatu layanan). Kendati demikian, sistem ini tidak sempurna. Orang bisa memberikan rating baik karena sopirnya ganteng atau cantik atau rating buruk hanya karena sopirnya tidak ramah. Ihwal yang tidak kasatmata seperti rem blong dan sebagainya tidak dengan mudah terefleksikan dalam rating ini.\nBisa jadi sopirnya ganteng atau cantik, tapi remnya blong dan tetap saja orang memberikan rating yang bagus. Walaupun sistem reputasi ini tidak sempurna, setidaknya ini memberikan cerminan atas kualitaslayanan. Sisteminijugadapat disempurnakan untuk bisa merefleksikan standar pelayanan transportasi pada umumnya.\nApakah self regulation ini bisa efektif? Kita tidak tahu. Mau tidak mau, sharing economy melakukan disrupsi terhadap pemain lama. Tapi, yang jelas, self regulation akan tetap lebih baik dibandingkan no regulation atau pelarangan total. Uber dan GoJek juga seharusnya tertarik dengan proposal self regulation ini karena dengan metode ini intervensi pemerintah akan minim.\nDitambah lagi, yang sudah dan sedang mereka lakukan selama ini sebenarnya juga sebuah self regulation. Secara teoritis, kita bisa mengetahui apabila self regulation ini efektif ketika perubahan perilaku dan turunnya biaya sosial yang diakibatkan dari aktivitas ekonomi. Katakanlah, apabila standar keselamatan naik dan keluhan penumpang turun, kita bisa tahu bahwa metode ini efektif.\nYang harus dilakukan pemerintah saat ini adalah untuk menentukan bagian-bagian mana yang akan diberlakukan self regulation dan bagian-bagian mana yang tetap akan diberlakukan command-and-control. Bagi saya, prinsip yang harus diberlakukan dalam self regulation adalah same service, same standard. Artinya, standar-standar umum keselamatan transportasi harus berlaku sama bagi Uber dan GoJek maupun taksi konvensional.\nTinggal permasalahannya, bagaimana standar ini akan ditegakkan. Dalam regulasi commandand- control, standar layanan ini bisa ditegakkan oleh DLLAJ dengan melakukan KIR atau pengecekan kendaraan. Nah, dalam self regulation penegakan aturan harusnya dapat dilaksanakan oleh Uber dan GoJek sendiri. Caranya bagaimana, apakah petugas Uber harus memeriksa satu persatu armadanya?\nSaya kira tidak.

Satu hal yang banyak disepakati adalah perusahaan yang menyediakan platform marketplace seperti di atas membutuhkan kategori tersendiri di luar dari perusahaan IT atau perusahaan transportasi. Perusahaan-perusahaan ini sebaiknya diatur dengan model self-regulation (Cohen-Sundarajan, 2015).\nSelf-regulation dipraktikkan, misalnya, dalam pengaturan organisasi profesi seperti advokat, notaris, kedokteran, dan dalam beberapa hal, penjara dan sekolah. Dalam banyak contoh tersebut regulasi tak lagi terpusat pada pemerintah melainkan berkembang dalam lokus-lokus tersendiri (Black 2001).\nJustifikasi atas self-regulation ini setidaknya bisa kita lihat dari (i) kapasitas regulasi dan (ii) insentif regulasi.\nDari sisi kapasitas regulasi, tampak bahwa ongkos regulasi yang harus dibayar oleh pemerintah akan besar apabila harus mendata satu persatu pengemudi Gojek dan Uber dan melakukan pengawasan terhadap ketaatan setiap pengemudinya atas standar pelayanan minimal. Sementara itu, Gojek dan Uber lebih memiliki kapasitas karena secara otomatis punya data dari setiap pengemudi, lengkap dengan pemeringkatannya serta keluhan penumpang atas pengemudi.\nSedangkan dari sisi insentif regulasi, kita dapat menilainya lewat dua faktor: (a) insentif untuk menegakkan dan (b) insentif untuk menaati aturan. Dari sisi insentif untuk menegakkan, aparat pemerintah memiliki insentif, misalnya, lewat lewat promosi jabatan. Namun demikian, Gojek/Uber memiliki insentif lebih karena berhubungan dengan reputasi dan kualitas layanannya. Biaya yang diperlukan perusahaan tersebut dalam memutuskan pemilik sumberdaya dari jaringan sangat kecil dibandingkan dengan, misalnya, biaya dalam melakukan sidang tilang.\nDemikian juga dari sisi ketaatan. Soal memberikan helm bagi penumpang, misalnya, insentif utama bagi pengemudi ojek adalah akan ditangkap polisi. Namun, apabila ada ancaman lain seperti dilaporkan oleh penumpang kepada perusahaan, maka insentifnya dalam menaati peraturan akan bertambah.\nDengan demikian, peranan pemerintah (atas menu-menu regulasi tertentu) bukanlah sebagai penegak langsung atas aturan (enforcer) melainkan penegak tidak langsung. Pemerintah cukup membuat kerangkanya regulasinya dan meminta akuntabilitas ketaatan secara umum dari perusahaan. Yang menjadi pelaksana dan penegak regulasi adalah perusahaan-perusahaan tersebut langsung kepada para pengemudi.\nPemerintah bisa membuat standar tingkat ketaatan rata-rata minimal dari pengemudi (misalnya, jumlah rata rata kecelakaan) dan kemudian menjatuhkan denda apabila perusahaan tidak memenuhinya. Dengan cara ini, Uber/Gojek akan dipacu untuk terus melakukan penyuluhan keselamatan kepada pengemudi.\nBaca artikel lengkapnya di Geotimes:\nJokowi dan Problem Regulasi Ekonomi Berbagi oleh Mohamad Mova Al’Afghani\n Posted by: Unknown \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2016-04-conventional-regulations-wont-work-for.html":{"slug":"blog/2016-04-conventional-regulations-wont-work-for.html","filePath":"blog/2016-04-conventional-regulations-wont-work-for.html.md","title":"Conventional regulations won't work for 'sharing' economies | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":[],"tags":["regulation-»","sharing-economy-»"],"content":"regulation », sharing economy »\nConventional regulations won’t work for ‘sharing’ economies\nThursday, April 14, 2016   Movanet \n\nAn excerpt from my OpEd in The Jakarta Post:\nWhat is certain is that the old economy is being redefined. Even jobs are being redefined. Information technology is slowly but surely shifting “employee” into “workforce-as-service”. There will be fewer employees and more part-time work-from-home consultants. There will be fewer people going to offices and more people teleconferencing through virtual reality gadgets.\nFor lawyers, this means that the traditional elements of labor law, wages, authority (e.i. from a boss) and “a defined job”, are no longer fulfilled. The new workforce has more independence and outcome-rather-than-process orientation. So authority is rather irrelevant. They also receive commissions instead of wages. They also may not have a set of “defined jobs” — they may be working here and there on several projects.\nFor that reason, the existing Manpower Law may not be necessarily relevant for the sharing economy. Thus the government shouldn’t force manpower laws on Uber and Go-Jek. This is not to suggest that the new workforce should be deprived of their traditional protections — in terms of health insurance and pension funds and other benefits — that are traditionally provided by offices. It simply means that the government needs to think of new ways so that these protections remain available when the workforce has shifted from employment to services.\nThe same reason goes for transportation platforms. Taxis, for example, must comply with minimum service standards, such as being equipped with taximeters, assurance of driver’s physical condition, maximum working hours, vehicle maximum age and general safety standards such as functional seatbelts, functional brakes and regular checking to ensure that the vehicle is roadworthy. All these standards must be available to Uber’s or GrabTaxi’s customers too.\nThe real problem is how to apply these standards to a sharing economies platform. The government should not confuse regulatory goals with regulatory formalities. Subjecting vehicles to yellow license plates or registering them with specific licenses are regulatory formalities (means) to regulatory goals (ends), which is, among others, safety.\nNow how do we get them to obey these standards? The current academic proposal from experts worldwide is through self-regulation. Some called them “shared regulations”, which denotes shared regulatory competence among several regulatory authorities and the companies themselves. Unfortunately this idea has not caught the attention of Indonesian policymakers and they are preoccupied with applying existing legal definitions to Uber, Grab or Go-Jek. As I previously mentioned, it won’t work because they can’t be categorized as per se IT or transportation companies.\nSee full article here.\n Posted by: Movanet \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2016-04-end-of-term-report-ogp-irm.html":{"slug":"blog/2016-04-end-of-term-report-ogp-irm.html","filePath":"blog/2016-04-end-of-term-report-ogp-irm.html.md","title":"End of Term Report OGP IRM | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":["assets/pdfs/asset_00044_Indo_ProgressReport3_PubCommBahasa.pdf","mailto:mova@alafghani.info","mailto:pwpiupiu@gmail.com"],"tags":[],"content":"End of Term Report OGP IRM\nSunday, April 3, 2016   Unknown \n\nMekanisme Pelaporan Independen Kemitraan Pemerintahan Terbuka saat ini memasuki tahapan laporan akhir (End of Term Report).

According to some calculations, this ambitious target cannot be fulfilled by relying on regional water utilities (Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum or “PDAM”) alone. It is estimated that PDAM can only contribute around 40% of the total target, whereas the other 60% would be expected to come from community‐based systems. The policy framework for CB Watsan was introduced by the government in 2003. The 2003 National Policy on The Development of Community‐Based Water and Sanitation introduced a duality in Indonesian national water policy: one being “institution‐based” and the other being “community‐based”. O\n\n\nThe conceptual problem surrounding “community‐based” watsan is on the definition and delineation between CB watsan and institutional watsan. In the policy framework, the term “institution‐based” is used to denote water services operated by corporate water utilities including PDAM, whereas “community‐based” is used to describe services provided by local communities for their own needs. How communities and institutions are defined, at least in the academic sense, might not be compatible with what is intended by the policy framework.\n\n\nThere are also inconsistencies and discrepancies in the regulatory framework from the national down to regional and village levels, with regards to the role of CB watsan. The legal framework at the national level appears to favour “institution” based watsan, such as PDAM. Community based Watsan’s role are considered to be residual – in providing access only where “institutional” system cannot serve.\n\n\nWithin the community based watsan itself, there is a major issue with regards to the clarity of assets ownership. Our Focus Group Discussion reveals that in some large scale projects, the assets still belong to the ministry of public works as it has not been transferred and thus, is accounted as liability and subsidy. FGD participants agreed that “Assets transfer is Indeed a big homework. The legal frameworks need to be completed.”\n\n\nSome community watsan activist considered that assets should be owned by the “communities” whereas according to another, it should be owned by the village. The national policy on community‐based watsan on the other hand, advocates “community” ownership and suggests that a legal framework be conceived by the government to smoothen the transfer of assets from the government to the “community”. On the Pamsimas program technical manual it is suggested that it is the operation that is transferred, but not the asset owenership.\n\n\nWe also found that there are cases where PDAM systems overlap and compete with CB Watsan. This is caused, partly by the introduction of the dualist system of watsan services in the 2003 framework. How these community watsan initiatives could coexist with existing PDAMs or – to maintain the economies of scale – be merged with or acquire existing PDAMs is a problem which yet to be solved, let alone, researched.\n\n\nThe FGD reveals that there are unresolved fundamental differences among regulatory stakeholders, in terms of whether CB should be perceived as a temporary “approach” with the overall intention to integrate it to the PDAM or “institutional” system in the future, or whether is stands equally to the existing “institutional” system.\n\n\nThere are also problems with respect to service standards and how the government can foster monitoring, supervision and enforcement of such standards through regulatory frameworks. Community initiative and demand‐driven approach is central to the community watsan movement. However, this approach is at odds with existing national legal frameworks requiring water and sanitation services to comply with minimum service standards enacted by local government.\n\n\nWhether or not similar standards should apply to both government owned water utilities and community watsan is a matter of debate. Some interpret “universal water provision” in the sense that similar quality, quantity, continuity, affordability should be applicable to everyone and every service providers. However, such ideal standard is difficult to achieve in Indonesian rural water provision, especially in the remote regions such as Nusa Tenggara and Papua.\n\n\nVisit Regulation of Community Water and Sanitation project page to download reports.\n Posted by: Unknown \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2016-07-regulation-of-community-water-and.html":{"slug":"blog/2016-07-regulation-of-community-water-and.html","filePath":"blog/2016-07-regulation-of-community-water-and.html.md","title":"Regulation of Community Water and Sanitation (Temporary or Permanent?) | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Regulation of Community Water and Sanitation (Temporary or Permanent?)\nSaturday, July 30, 2016   Unknown \n\nPicture: water network diagram in Tlanak\nOne of the most interesting findings in our research is the relationship between community based water services and existing water utilities. We find patterns of cooperation and conflict. One of the underlying reason is the different perception as to whether community based systems should be considered a “temporary” solution or a “permanent” solution. This still cannot be resolved among policymakers:\n\nOur FGD revealed that there are unresolved fundamental differences among regulatory stakeholders, in terms of whether CB should be perceived as a temporary “approach” with the overall intention to integrate it to the PDAM or “institutional” system in the future or whether it stands equally to the existing “institutional” system.[152] This difference has created tensions and confusion in practice, but more importantly, brings negative impact to policy and regulatory reform.\n\n\nAccording to a government official some PDAM consider that CB Watsan is a temporary solution in their business plan – thus Community watsan network is regarded as parts which can be co-opted and taken over, since PDAM considers that the only one who is entitled to provide services are PDAM and the rest can only provide services through concession with PDAM.[153]\n\n\nIn addition, community watsan projects may, to some extent, contravene the exclusive natural-legal-local monopoly granted to PDAM. Furthermore, there is indication that some successful community watsan intitiative have grown large in a way that could match or even surpass existing PDAM.[154] How these community watsan initiatives could coexist with existing PDAMs or – to maintain the economies of scale – be merged with or acquire existing PDAMs is a problem yet to be solved.\n\n\nThe importance of modeling behaviors and future development in order to develop understanding of the relationship between PDAM and CB was a common response across the FGD. Two fragment-scenarios may be a suitable approach to be able to foresee regulatory developments. The first is to view community watsan as a “temporary” entity which exist only for a certain period and can be “annexed” by PDAM for certain reason such as economic scale or environmental conditions such as surface water quality in which CB model would no longer be compatible and larger scale investment would be required for treatment. The temporary approach is consistent with existing regulation — since existing laws considers that the only one who is entitled to provide services are State or Regional Owned Enterprises — whilst the other may only provide services in concession with PDAM. If this scenario is to be taken, then regulatory reform should focus on short term solutions with the overall objective of integrating the whole system to PDAM.\n\n\nThe second scenario is to perceive CB as a completely different model that can develop, expand and supersede PDAM or other “institutional” system. CB is thus treated equally with “institution”. As, at present, there is no CB model above district [Kecamatan] level, this model would be quite speculative. In this model, the regulatory framework should acknowledge the diversity of models in services provision and allow either CB or institutional model to acquire each other. FGD participants challenge the conceptual distinction of CB/”institution” based on assets size, coverage or natural monopoly. Thus, in this scenario, the regulatory framework should be able to foresee the CB model transformed into large scale water utility.\n\nRead the full research report.\nVisit project page: Regulation of Community Water and Sanitation.\n Posted by: Unknown \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2016-08-new-online-course-on-gender.html":{"slug":"blog/2016-08-new-online-course-on-gender.html","filePath":"blog/2016-08-new-online-course-on-gender.html.md","title":"New Online Course on Gender Mainstreaming in IWRM | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":["mailto:virtualcampus@cap-net.org"],"tags":[],"content":"New Online Course on Gender Mainstreaming in IWRM\nWednesday, August 3, 2016   Unknown \n|  |  |  |\nNew Online Course on Gender Mainstreaming in IWRM ____\nAt Cap-Net UNDP we are proud to present a new online course on  Gender Mainstreaming in IWRM on the Cap-Net Virtual Campus.

The program includes visits to the Swedish Toxicology Science Research Center (Swetox), the Swedish National Food Agency, and the City of Stockholm Environment and Health Administration.\n\nCRPG’s Presentation\n Posted by: Mita \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2016-11-plastic-shopping-bag-levy-one-of-ways.html":{"slug":"blog/2016-11-plastic-shopping-bag-levy-one-of-ways.html","filePath":"blog/2016-11-plastic-shopping-bag-levy-one-of-ways.html.md","title":"Plastic Shopping Bag Levy:  One of the Ways to Tackle the Waste Problem? | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":[],"tags":["environment-»","levy-»","plastics-»","policy-»","tax-»"],"content":"environment », levy », plastics », policy », tax »\nPlastic Shopping Bag Levy: One of the Ways to Tackle the Waste Problem?\nThursday, November 3, 2016   Mita \nCRPG has contributed to the policy discussion regarding the plastic shopping bag levy that was introduced in February 2016 in several cities in Indonesia. The article, written by Dyah Paramita, was published in the Jakarta Post. The following is an excerpt:\nPlastic waste is a problem**.** It is very difficult to decompose naturally and when it burns, it releases toxins such as dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that are very harmful for human health and the environment and is linked to the development of cancer. Animals also suffer from the ingestion of plastic. According to the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, the use of plastic bags in Indonesia for the past 10 years is increasing. In the past decade, Indonesians used approximately 9.8 billion sheets of plastic bags per year and almost 95% of them ended up as waste.  Based on a recent study published in the Science Magazine written by Jenna R. Jambeck, the country ranks second (after China) that mismanaged plastic waste followed by the Philippines, Vietnam and Sri Lanka.\nIn order to handle the growing problem in Indonesia, a policy regarding the shopping plastic bag levy will be imposed on a trial basis. The policy is geared specifically for consumers shopping in modern markets and retail outlets and will be imposed from February 21, on the National Waste Awareness Day, to June 5, 2016, the World Environment Day. At the completion of the trial phase, the regulatory framework is expected to be completed by June 2016. The local governments of 23 cities have shown interest in participating in this movement (Jakarta Post 05/02/16). The Ministry of Environment and Forestry (KLHK) has proposed the charge of Rp. 500 per bag. Of this amount, Rp. 200 will be repaid to the consumers who return the plastic bags to the retailers and the rest (Rp. 300) will be used by the retailers and the local municipality to fund environmental activities. However, the price might vary and could range between Rp. 500-Rp. 5000, depending on the local policy (Kompas 26/01/16).\nWill the plastic bag levy tackle the waste problem? A plastic bag levy is not a new concept in the environmental field. Several countries have already introduced this policy, such as Taiwan, Ireland, Hong Kong, Botswana, China and Denmark.\nThere are different approaches regarding this matter. A levy on plastic shopping bags can be imposed to encourage the change of the consumers’ behavior. In this case, the main goal is to discourage consumers from using plastic bags, which will decrease the amount of litter and reduce the volume of waste going to the landfill. The amount of the levy is intended to deter consumers from using plastic shopping bags and to encourage them to bring their own bag. Ireland applies this type of levy. The KLHK seems to be proposing similar type of levy combined with the deposit-refund system. The deposit-refund system means when a product, which potentially pollutes the environment, is sold, a deposit should be charged simultaneously. Thus, the deposit will be re-funded when the consumers return the empty containers to the collection points. It is similar to the policy known as the “bottle bill” in the United States. The consumers pay a deposit when they purchase beverage containers and they are refunded their money when they return the empty containers to the retailers or to the designated collections points. One of the objectives of the deposit-refund system is to prevent improper waste disposal.\nAnother approach is imposing a Pigouvian tax on the plastic bag. The name is taken from the British university professor, Arthur Cecil Pigou who coined the theory. This way, the tax is intended to internalize the external cost of using the plastic bags. The external cost in this sense is the environmental costs, which include pollution, waste problems, and damage to wildlife. To implement this type of tax, there are efforts to calculate the margin of the external costs and determine the optimum level of the tax accordingly. This is also a way to reduce pollution and protect the environment by discouraging excessive consumption of plastic bags. This policy reflects what is called the polluter-pay principle, meaning those who cause pollution should bear the cost of managing it.\nSee full article here\n Posted by: Mita \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2017-05-dilema-kepemimpinan-kultus.html":{"slug":"blog/2017-05-dilema-kepemimpinan-kultus.html","filePath":"blog/2017-05-dilema-kepemimpinan-kultus.html.md","title":"Dilema Kepemimpinan Kultus | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Dilema Kepemimpinan Kultus\nThursday, May 4, 2017  Mohammad Jibriel Avessina\nDilema Kepemimpinan Kultus\n**\n**\nMohammad Jibriel Avessina\n(Analis Politik, Center for Regulation,Policy and Governance)\nPraktik kepemimpinan kultus kerapkali dilaksanakan sebagai strategi kebudayan yang dilakukan oleh gerakan spiritualisme baru ataupun gerakan sosial budaya baru . Dalam konteks ini kepemimpinan kultus disusun untuk mempertahanakan struktur yang dibentuk dari satuan sosial yang terikat atas komitmen nilai ataupun pandangan yang mutlak. Maka lazim kita temukan pemimpin-pemimpin kultus berangkat dari kelompok-kelompok subkultur marjinal yang mengisolasi diri,menjaga jarak dari kultur-kultur yang lebih dominan secara sosial.\nNamun demikian, tidak seluruh kepemimpinan kultus,berangkat dari kelompok sosial yang kecil. Kepemimpinan kultus dapat saja muncul dari arus mainstream kultur yang dominan secara sosial,tatkala keadaan turbulensi sosial hadir di dalam masyarakat (Maisntream), kepemimpian kultus jeli melihat peluang dalam mengeksplorasi tanda tanda disintegrasi sosial berupa potensi konflik laten yang tajam antar golongan di masyarakat (Zellner,1998) . Kajian yang dilakukan William Zellner dalam bukunya Sects, Cults, and Spiritual Communities(1998),dapat kita simpulkan empat karakteristik kepemimpinan kultus.\nPertama Karakter kepemimpinan kultus ditandai oleh pesona pribadi yang kuat dengan memberikan tawaran janji pembaharuan radikal atau janji pemurnian ,murni atas nilai dan kesepakatan sosial yang dianggap telah jatur dan tercemar di Masyarakat, sehingga mengundang arus simpati dan decak kagum di masyarakat.\nKedua, Pemimpin kultus mampu mengeksplorasi rekayasa atribut identitas sosial dengan baik sehingga menciptakan ketergantungan para pengikutnya yang berasal dari latar belakang lanskap sosial yang beragam atas pemimpin kultus berikut struktur yang telah dibangunnya.\nKetiga, pemimpin kultus biasanya memberikan kewajiban cara pandang,perspektif tunggal tertentu yang patut dijadikan pedoman doktrin mutlak dalam kehidupan spiritual dan sosial budaya, cara pandang tunggal semacam ini tentu saja menutup mata atas beragam kritik sosial maupun keberagaman pendapat yang berbeda dalam kehidupan bermasyarakat,maka tidak mengherankan pengikut yang terikat oleh pemimpin kultus cenderung berlaku agresif dan memendam curiga terhadap atas segala pilihan perbedaan pendapat dan kritik kritik sosial yang ditujukan bagi sang pemimpin kultus.\nKeempat pemimpin kultus membentuk mekanisme kontrol sosial Reward and Punishment yang ketat. Mekanisme ini biasanya dibentuk untuk mengatur dinamika internal kalangan pengikutnya yang kuat untuk menjamin loyalitas dan perilaku para pengikut pemimpin kultus agar senantiasa tunduk secara absolut dengan kehendak pemimpin kultus.\nKepemimpinan Kultus dalam arena politik\nSecara kultural, dalam arena politik Indonesia narasi tentang kepemimpinan kultus telah lama eksis. Kepemimpinan kultus, kerapkali dilekatkan sebagai solusi di mata rakyat (Popular Grassroot) dalam menentukan kepemimpinan politik pada kondisi yang penuh ketidakteraturan sosial yang tidak menentu. Praktik kepemimpinan kultus yang masuk dalam arena politik misalnya dapat dilihat dari populernya di kalangan rakyat jelata mitos tentang pola kepemimpinan Ratu adil dan Satrio piningit, sosok yang muncul di dalam masyarakat sebagai aktor pengikat tunggal integrasi sosial yang menawarkan suatu tatanan zaman yang baru. Zaman yang tenteram sejahtera, setelah tatanan sosial lama telah rusak,oleh “Goro-goro” yakni suatu kondisi ketidakteraturan sosial yang diwarnai dengan beragam pertikaian internal di Masyarakat. Mitos ini begitu populer ditengah tengah masyarakat, ada semacam penantian dan pengharapan akan muncul pemimpin-pemimpin semacam ini pada periode-periode tertentu yang penuh gejolak sosial. Dalam konteks ini dapat kita pahami bahwa praktik-praktik kepemimpinan kultus sebagai strategi kebudayaan yang muncul dalam periode tertentu diam diam mendapatkan dukungan yang cukup kuat dari akar rumput.\nMaka dapat kita pahami bahwa pemimpin di masa lalu kerapkali terjerumus dalam mode praktik kepemimpinan kultus. Praktik kepemimpinan kultus dilakukan sebagai alternatif strategi kebudayaan untuk menggalang dukungan sentimen sosial untuk meraih dan mempertahankan kekuasaan. Maka tidak heran bila pemimpin-pemimpin terdahulu mengenggam sirkuit kekuasaan dalam waktu yang cukup lama,berkisar antara belasan tahun hingga puluhan tahun lamanya. Organisasi-organisasi sosial dan politik justru muncul sebagai pionir pemujaan atas figur pemimpin secara akut. Gelar-gelar adiluhung disematkan pada dada pemimpin-pemimpin tedahulu. Sebagai pelengkap, Kidung-kidung nyanyian digubah sebagai refleksi pemujaan atas pemimpin yang kerap dipertontonkan rutin dalam acara acara seremonial.\nPada dekade tahun 1970-an, kita dikejutkan oleh berkembangnya pola birokrasi patrimonial suatu cita rasa birokrasi “kebapakan” yang mengedepankan ikatan ikatan sentimental personal untuk kepentingan pribadi, kelompok yang menggunakan birokrasi sebagai kontrol sumberdaya untuk mempertahankan kekuasaan. Kenyataan ini menunjukan pada kita bahwa praktik kepemimpinan kultus yang sudah hadir puluhan generasi ternyata mampu adaptif dengan perkembangan kemajuan atas pengetahuan teknik-teknik organisasi paling kekinian sekalipun.\nNamun demikian,dampak yang paling merusak dalam praktik kepemimpinan kultus justru muncul ditengah tengah masyarakat. Pemujaan-pemujaan kolosal atas figur-figur pemimpin tertentu yang diikuti dengan ketaatan mutlak atas pandangan dan sikap sang pemimpin kultus. Demi untuk melaksanakan pembenaran atas keputusan pemimpin kultus, stigma dan label dilekatkan pada kelompok-kelompok sosial yang berbeda pandangan bahkan berlawanan atas kelompok kelompok sosial yang berkuasa. pada puncaknya fase senjakala kejatuhan para pemimpin pemimpin kultus selalu ditutup oleh “ goro-goro ” ketegangan-ketegangan sosial yang berujung pada konflik baik laten maupun manifes, selebihnya adalah cerita tentang masyarakat yang terbelah .\nRacun bagi demokrasi.\nKini, hampir dua dekade setelah reformasi,zaman telah berubah, kita telah menyaksikan tumbuhnya beragam generasi pemimpin baru. Sistem,struktur dan kelembagaan politik sudah mulai terbangun dengan matang dan kokoh dengan hanya memberikan ruang bagi demokrasi sebagai satu satunya prosedur tata aturan main, the only game in town. Namun demikian,di luar tatanan struktur politik formal,tanda tanda kepemimpinan kultus kembali menggeliat.\nPemujaan kekaguman terhadap “berhala figur idola” kembali marak dipraktikan oleh beragam kelompok sosial. Kritik-kritik sosial tak lagi di terima sebagai bagian tradisi dari ruang publik yang sehat, tetapai dimaknai dengan penuh kecurigaan,ancaman serta dianggap upaya untuk menjatuhkan kredibilitas sang “pemimpin idola”. Maka tidak heran, pelan tapi pasti cara pandang “kacamata kuda” yang memuja cinta figur-figur “pemimpin idola” begitu mengakar di masyarakat. Demi untuk menyanjung pemimpin idola, ruang publik diokupasi,didominasi praktik kekerasan simbolik, label dan stigma kerapkali dilekatkan secara brutal pada kelompok kelompok sosial yang dianggap berbeda pendapat, pandangan atau haluan politik.\nRangkaian batas kultural mulai dibangun dengan menciptakan dikotomi Lover and hater yang populer pada sirkulasi ruang virtual social media. Kondisi ini menandakan fragmentasi politik pada masyarakat yang akut,bukan karena pertarungan atas pilihan-pilihan rasional tentang program, gagasan atau ideologi tapi karena arus kental pemujaan buta atas sosok figur. Dalam sekejap tradisi kritik,berbagi wacana dalam ruang publik lenyap, tak ada ruang konsensus. Secara perlahan tapi pasti diam diam dipupuk ketidakpercayaan serta antipati kuat atas sistem dan kelembagaan, maka pemimpin idola dipandang sebagai satu satunya jalan untuk mewujudkan sistem berada pada jalan yang dianggap “benar”.Tanpa “kehadiran-Nya” sistem dan kelembagaan dianggap tidak mungkin berjalan dengan baik. Dia tiada mungkin tergantikan, tak ada yang dapat mampu menyamainya.\nMaka, tatkala pemimpin idola tumbang melalui proses pertarungan yang demokratis, kepanikan di mata pengikut pemimpin idola mulai terjadi. Dia yang dianggap tak tergantikan ternyata tumbang. Sirkulasi opini mulai diedarkan untuk menjelaskan bait demi bait dongeng “Kambing hitam” penyebab kekalahannya akibat “konspirasi kaum-kaum kegelapan nan jahat untuk melawan kebenaran”. Ketakutan-ketakutan mulai ditebar di tengah tengah komunitas komunitas kelompok masyarakat oleh para pengikut pemimpin idola yang kecewa. Pesannya satu, jika Dia tiada memimpin maka tiada terbentuk keteraturan sosial yang utuh. Hanya Dia yang agung yang mampu melindungi rakyat dari potensi kekacauan sosial. Pada puncaknya, para pengikut pemimpin idola secara kolektif mengekspresikan rasa kegalauan yang begitu meluap sejadi-jadinya dalam ruang ruang publik untuk melepas sang pemimpin idola pergi.\nSulit untuk dibantah, realitas kultural semacam ini menunjukan gejala-gejala tidak sehat munculnya benih benih narasi kepemimpinan kultus di masyarakat. Sejenak kita bersama perlu merefleksikan kembali,menata ulang bangunan sistem dan kelembagaan demokrasi kita. Gejala semacam ini mengingatkan kita untuk tidak lengah dalam ruang kultural untuk mengawal nalar publik, sebab penting sebagai fondasi untuk mewujudkan bangunan kelembagaan demokrasi kita. Demi publik,untuk republik.\n.\nMohammad Jibriel Avessina\n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2017-05-politik-jalan-ketiga-anies.html":{"slug":"blog/2017-05-politik-jalan-ketiga-anies.html","filePath":"blog/2017-05-politik-jalan-ketiga-anies.html.md","title":"Politik Jalan Ketiga Anies | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":["file:/C:/Users/Jibriel-Avessina/Desktop/Politik-Jalan-ketiga-Anies.docx"],"tags":[],"content":"Politik Jalan Ketiga Anies\nSunday, May 7, 2017  Mohammad Jibriel Avessina\nPolitik “Jalan ketiga” Anies[1]\nKemunculan Anies Baswedan dalam putaran kedua pilkada DKI merupakan sebuah peristiwa politik yang menarik untuk diulas. Dari segi politik jejak rekam figur Anies Baswedan dikenal unik,beragam dan fleksibel, Anies dikenal publik pernah ikut mencalonkan diri sebagai presiden dalam konvensi partai demokrat pada tahun 2013, setelah itu anies ikut mengemban peran vital dalam tim pemenangan Jokowi sebagai presiden, lalu sekarang dicalonkan sebagai gubenur dari partai-partai politik oposisi. Namun demikian ada satu benang merah yang konsisten,penampilannya dalam ruang publik selalu memukau, serta berkeinginan hadir sebagai alternative baru dalam politik . Bila disimpulkan, seorang Anies merupakan sosok pemimpin dangan gaya Solidarity maker yakni suatu __ tipe pemimpin klasik khas Indonesia.\nTipologi solidarity maker tersebut dicetuskan oleh Hebert Feith dalam bukunya The Decline of Constitutional democracy in Indonesia (Feith, 1962) sebagai pemimpin khas yang punya pola komunikasi yang baik, hadir dalam merangkul beragam kelompok kelompok kepentingan serta berbicara tentang gagasan orisinil yang besar . Ada pesan penting yang selalu disampaikan oleh Anies dalam rangkaian gagasan populernya tentang merajut tenun kebangsaan ataupun melunasi janji kemerdekaan , Anies konsisten memperjuangkan gagasan untuk menjaga keutuhan modal sosial sebagai kunci kehidupan bermasyarakat. Perolehan suaranya yang mencapai sekitar 57,95 persen menurut hitungan resmi KPU, menunjukan keberagaman harapan dukungan komuniti-komuniti akar rumpun yang relatif besar terhadap kepemimpinannya. Dalam konteks ini setidaknya ada dua hal yang menarik untuk diulas lebih dalam untuk membaca tawaran gagasan kepemimpinan politik Anies .\nPertama, Anies merupakan elit pertama yang menawarkan diskusi terbuka secara massal,masuk ke dalam arena mainstream isu isu hak ekonomi sosial sebagai platform utama dalam kampanye politiknya . Tawaran gagasan Anies tersebut memberikan alternatif jalan tengah dari kontestasi politik elektoral yang telah jenuh diwarnai oleh isu-isu sipil dan politik yang terbagi dalam dua arus besar yakni arus konservatif maupun arus liberal. Pilihan Anies untuk mengusung gagasan isu sosial ekonomi sejalan dengan situasi masyarakat yang menghadapi ketimpangan sosial ekonomi yang cukup parah.\nGagasan ini cukup simpatik,ditengah tengah arus wacana politik perbedaan (politics of difference) yang mengeksplorasi atribut dan identitas sebagai komoditas politik menjadi sesuatu mainstream di tengah masyarakat. Anies melalui gagasan isu sosial-ekonomi melangkah maju membahas masalah masalah masyarakat yang kerapkali diabaikan dalam tataran elit.\nAnies,melalui isu ekonomi-sosial mampu menghadirkan satu jalan blok politik baru,Anies mampu merekatkan beragam komunitas yang berbeda pilihan dalam isu-isu sipil dan politik. Kelompok konservatif-relijius dalam gerakan Tarbiyah yang merupakan basis utama PKS, Komunitas-komunitas Patriotik yang merupakan basis Partai Gerindra, Kaukus kelompok kelompok kaum miskin kota yang merasakan dampak langsung dari kebijakan relokasi yang dilaksanakan oleh lawan politiknya, kelompok pro lingkungan hingga jaringan aktivis tata kota yang menghendaki perubahan penataan Jakarta dengan mengedepankan isu isu ekonomi sosial.\nKedua, platform dan narasi gagasan-gagasan oleh Anies mengingatkan kita atas prinsip-prinsip “ jalan ketiga” (Third Way) Giddens, hal ini misalnya terlihat dari pilihan garis ideologis “Jalan Ketiga” yakni akomodatif dengan pasar, perlindungan atas nilai nilai komunitas,proteksi atas lingkungan serta mendorong beragam program kesejahteraan untuk masyarakat (Giddens, 1998). Posisi Anies dalam mendorong perlindungan atas nilai nilai komunitas, dapat dilihat pilihannya dalam menolak kebijakan “relokasi’ dalam penataan perkotaan karena mecerabut akar sejarah, identitas, serta terbentuknya jaringan ekonomis masyarakat marjinal miskin perkotaan di Pinggiran, posisi Anies dalam menolak proses reklamasi dalam mekanisme pembentukan pulau pulau buatan menunjukan dirinya memiliki posisi dalam perlindungan atas lingkungan hidup.\nKita juga dapat menemukan komitmen-komitmen dalam platform politik Anies dalam mendorong tanggung jawab negara untuk kesejahteraan warganya, misalnya komitmen untuk menyediakan public housing, Komitmen untuk mewujudkan program kewirausahaan berbasis komunitas dengan keinginan untuk melahirkan 200.000 Wirausaha baru yang muncul sentra sentra usaha terpadu hingga pada level kecamatan. Anies juga menegaskan komitmennya dengan tawaran meningkatkan kualitas atas program kesejahteraan yang telah disusun oleh rezim terdahulu yaitu dengan janji program KJP plus maupun KJS Plus __.\nTantangan politik ke depan.\nTetapi posisi Anies sebagai figur pemimpin Solidarity Maker yang solid bukan hadir tanpa celah. Setidaknya ada tiga hal utama yang harus dibuktikannya pada publik luas. Persoalan pertama, sejauhmana Anies mampu melewati proses transisi 6 bulan secara mulus dan gemilang, beragam persoalan harus dihadapi pada masa inter-periode transisi. Persoalan kedua sejauhmana kontestasi dinamika politik dalam internal kaukus politiknya pada masa adminsitrasi pemerintahannya mampu untuk bertahan komitmen “jalan ketiga” Anies. Maka sedari awal Anies harus tegas untuk meletakan agenda ekonomi social dan budaya (EKOSOB) sebagai common program yang mengikat. Sehingga, dalam pertarungan power interplay dalam internal kaukus politiknya, baik dalam kebijakan publik maupun negosiasi distribusi kekuasaan terhadap kelompok pendukungnya tidak boleh menggeser Common Program Ekonomi,Sosial dan Budaya . Persoalan ini dikuti oleh adalah persoalan keraguan bagi sebagian publik kelas menengah bahwa Rezim Anies akan mampu fokus menurunkan gagasan-gagasan besar dalam detail detail perencanaan kerja yang bersifat apik dan konkrit. Persoalan ketiga, Anies perlu membuktikan dalam masa kepemimpinannya,mampu mengelola keterancaman keberagaman, seperti yang menjadi fokus tudingan kelompok kelompok liberal atas sentimen kehadiran kelompok konservatif politik yang mendukungnya sejak awal, sehingga ketakutan atas keterancaman keberagaman identitas perlu untuk dijawab rezim Anies.\nPertama, beragam permasalahan telah harus dihadapi pada masa masa “interperiode” kepemimpinan baru Anies, rencana penggusuran kembali kampung Aquarium yang kemungkinan akan dilaksanakan dalam waktu dekat,padahal Anies memiliki pendekatan yang jauh berbeda dalam melihat persoalan relokasi.\nDalam sisi lain, sejauh mana Anies dituntut mampu melakukan lobi pada petahanan sehingga program program kerja andalannya yang pro rakyat yakni DP 0 Rupiah,One Kecamatan,One Center (OKE OCE), KJS Plus dan KJP Plus mampu diakomodasi dalam APBD-P 2017 serta masuk dalam Kebijakan Umum Anggaran dan Plafon Prioritas Anggaran Sementara (KUA-PPAS) 2018. Masalah lain yang perlu dihadapi dalam periode waktu singkat adalah peran serta rezim Anies untuk merumuskan Rancangan Perencanaan Jangka Menengah Daerah (RPJMD) Jakarta untuk lima tahun ke depan masih menemui kendala. Padahal banyak gagasan dari Anies yang menarik untuk dimasukan dalam RPJMD, misalnya keinginan untuk membentuk Komite untuk mengurus dan mengelola dana CSR dari pemerintah DKI Jakarta.\nKedua,publik tentu saja menunggu konsistensi Anies dalam menerapkan policy yang berfokus pada aspek ekonomi,sosial dan budaya tetap bertahan dalam dinamika negosiasi politik internal kelompok kelompok politik pendukungnya. Anies harus mampu membuktikan konsistensinya untuk menolak melanjutkan pendekatan “relokasi” bagi masyarakat miskin kota. Anies juga harus membuktikan konsistensi menolak Reklamasi pantai utara Jakarta, adapun bagi pulau yang misalnya sudah terlanjur jadi, publik akan menunggu sikap Anies atas formulasi pemanfaatan pulau tersebut bagi orang banyak.\nAnies pun harus menjawab keraguan publik atas kemampuannya menurunkan gagasan-gagasan besar tersebut dalam detail tawaran yang konkrit dan matang, mengingat kompetitor politiknya dikenal sebagai figur pemimpin adminstratur yang tangguh serta cukup menguasai penjelasan detail detail teknis dalam setiap program yang ditawarkannya. Beberapa tawaran program unggulannya akan menjadi fokus sorotan publik seperti OK OCE dan DP 0 Persen . Dalam konteks ini, pada masa kepemimpinannya dia harus mampu membuktikan  success story atas program OK OCE,dalam mencetak wirausaha sosial baru, eksis ,mandiri berkelanjutan (sustainable).Lebih lanjut, pembuktian juga harus muncul dalam program “public housing” DP 0 rupiah, misalnya dengan memperhatikan klausul pendapatan per rumah tangga sebesar tujuh juta rupiah tentu saja relatif memberatkan masyarakat berpenghasilan rendah (MBR), bilamanakah memungkinkan MBR untuk mengakses program tersebut\nKetiga, pembuktian “jalan ketiga” Anies harus merangkul serta memberikan contoh bahwa keberagaman adalah keniscayaan. Anies perlu menunjukan bahwa persoalan mendesak adalah menjamin eksistensi dalam “lkeberagaman” kelas sosial untuk mendapatkan ruan hidup bersama bagi Jakarta ke depan. Maka, P\\pemberian contoh dapat dilakukan adalah membuktikan diri sebagai pengelola kekuasaan yang berimbang,stabil membangun consensus atas kelompok-kelompok kepentingan (Interest group) pendukungnya yang masing masing memiliki pandangan bertolak belakang dalam isu sipil-politik. Sejauhmana rezim Anies ke depan memberikan ruang konsensi kekuasaan pada kelompok konservatif agama dan konservatif sosial (Patriotik), Ruang konsensi politik apa yang akan diberikan pada kelompok lingkungan dan kelompok pro tata Kota maupun konsesi politik apa akan diberikan bagi kelompok miskin kota. Sejauhmana Anies akan mengakomodasi ruang kelompok pemodal dalam administrasi pemerintahannya ke depan. Pemberian keteladanan contoh tersebut perlu diikuti oleh konsistensi pembuatan regulasi daerah yang menjamin “keberagaman” kelas kelas social hidup,hadir mendapatkan ruang di Jakarta. Keterbukaan dalam menaungi berbagai pertarungan power interplay dalam internal rezim Anies tentu saja penting,sebab sebagai pembuktian stablitas dan keberagaman pada administrasi pemerintahan Anies ke depan.\n\n[1] Mohammad Jibriel Avessina, Analis Politik pada Center for Regulation Policy and Governance (CRPG)\nMohammad Jibriel Avessina\n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2017-07-increasing-local-government.html":{"slug":"blog/2017-07-increasing-local-government.html","filePath":"blog/2017-07-increasing-local-government.html.md","title":"Increasing local government responsibility for communal scale sanitation | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Increasing local government responsibility for communal scale sanitation\nWednesday, July 5, 2017   Unknown \nCRPG and the Institute for Sustainable Futures, University of Technology Sydney recently completed the research project “Increasing local government responsibility for communal scale sanitation” under the support of the Indonesia Infrastructure Initiative.

West Java\nDirector, Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)\nDespite the criticisms laid against the job creation bill, we need to commend the government for its courageous effort, not only to consolidate and harmonize around 70 laws, but also to introduce an overarching risk-based approach to our legal system.\nMost critics focus on two primary issues: (1) sectoral issues, arguments of which usually revolve around the “loss of protection”, be it for the environment, labor or certain aspects of human rights; and (2) procedural issues, with many criticizing the “omnibus” legislative process as lacking transparency.\nHowever, few have paid enough attention to the risk-based approach used in the bill, even though this mechanism will fundamentally alter our regulatory system and may even raise question on whether it would be compatible with our Constitution.\nRisk-based regulations require the government to prioritize regulatory burdens and resources toward “high-risk” activities. Risks, of course, constitute the “likelihood” and the “severity” of the potential impact of a particular activity: the higher the likelihood and the severity of the impact, the higher the risk.\nThe resources available to regulators for inspecting and monitoring are always limited. Thus, why spend taxpayer’s money on small risks? Regulations would be more efficient if resources are spent only on high-risk activities – or so the theory goes.\nIndeed, the job creation bill follows this approach. Only high-risk businesses will require a license (Article 11) and the level of supervision depends on the level of risk: Hence, the higher the risk, the more intense the scrutiny. This sounds about right, except for the fact that theories on risk-based regulation have moved past this.\nThe bill overlooks two things that are addressed in the regulatory policy literature: volatile risk and cumulative risk.\nThe former refers to risks that could be high during a certain season but low during another. For example, theft and burglary in residential areas are volatile risks: They increase during long holiday seasons such as Idul Fitri when millions of people travel back to their hometowns, but are relatively low during normal days. Fortunately, these risks are predictable, so homeowners can hire additional security during Idul Fitri. However, other risks like those related to climate change may not be so obvious.\nOther risks could be low or medium but they are actually systemic and thus, incur cumulative costs on society. Homeowners, for example, may park their second vehicles on a neighborhood street without permission. If we look at this individually, then the risk (in terms of severity) is low compared to truck owners who park their vehicles on the street. But if everyone does this (since a permit is not required), then the street will become clogged with vehicles and becomes a systemic risk.\nWe can see here that “locking down” regulatory resources and licensing only high-risk activities could be very dangerous, as this would mean that regulators will be legally required to ignore both volatile and cumulative risks.\nThe job creation bill contains a paradox: It aims to broaden the discretion of public officials, but the clauses in Articles 8 and 11 actually narrow it.\nTargeting supervision to “high risk” (Article 11) also contradicts theories on regulatory policy. It is not always the case that high-risk activities must be exposed to intense supervision. Theoretically speaking, a risk-based regulatory approach shifts the burden of risk from regulator to the companies’ risk management system. In other words, if the companies manage their risks, no matter how high, the level of supervision can be reduced. This can be proven over time through their compliance records. Although this is the general rule, the UK’s Hampton Report of 2005 warned that random checks on historically compliant firms were still required.\nArticle 8 “locks down” the types of risk to several subjects: health, security, environment and natural resource use. Strictly speaking, anything outside of these four subjects are not considered a risk.\nWhat if a certain cultural heritage might be lost due to certain business activities? Let’s say a traditional community holds a religious ceremony on a site they consider sacred, but the local government wants to build a shopping mall there. Is that activity not considered a risk? Unfortunately, no. If Article 8 makes it into law, then local governments can be legally forbidden from considering threats to cultural heritage as a risk.\nThis also shows that risk is a matter of perception. What constitutes a risk is different from person to person and from culture to culture. Whether a risk is deemed high or low can also differ from one person to another. Whether a risk is acceptable or not is also a matter of perception. The “risk” of risk-based regulation is that it may reduce regulatory activities into mere actuarial activities.\nAnother risk that risk-based regulations pose is the risk to public accountability. We cannot blame public officials from failing to address cumulative risks and other issues that are not considered a risk by law (such as the aforementioned cultural heritage).\nIn fact, risk-based regulations can be linked to bureaucratic incentives. For example, directorates and work units can be evaluated in terms of their budget. Have they used their budget “efficiently”, that is, in supervising only high-risk activities? If yes, then they are rewarded for their performance; if not, then they are penalized.\nThis can be dangerous, however, since officials are deliberately incentivized to ignore volatile and cumulative risks. Hence, “risks” can be used to measure the performance and budgetary accountability of a government unit, but at the same time, the government unit can evade accountability for activities that are not legally considered “risks”.\nFinally, predetermining the types of risk in the bill (Article 8, point 3) will eventually cause confusion. In other countries such as the UK, risk identification always starts with a regulator’s interpretation of its statutory objectives (Black and Baldwin, 2012, Baldwin 2012), and “risks” are those issues that impede the attainment of those objectives. For the England-Wales water regulator (OFWAT), its objective is to “further the consumer objective”, and secondly to “secure … the functions of a water undertaker”. OFWAT then develops its risk-based approach for several items, from water shortages during drought to contamination and to burst pipes (OFWAT, 2015).\nTherefore, in both the literature and practice, “risk” is determined by interpreting the statutes first and then detailing the subjects according to each agency’s regulatory objectives. OFWAT will thus have a different risk set compared to the telecommunications regulator OFTEL, for example.\nIndonesia seems to be taking a different approach in the job creation bill, wherein the general types of risk are predetermined according to Article 8(3): health, safety, environment and natural resource use. If regulators actually experience certain risks in practice that do not fall into these categories, they will be overlooked. Our society will then bear the cost of this oversight.\nNone of the above issues were discussed as far as the academic draft of the bill is concerned. The only relevant literature mentioned in the academic draft is the OECD’s 2010 “Risk and Regulatory Policy” report, which is wholly inadequate for a bill that could fundamentally alter our regulatory system.\n Posted by: Movanet \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2020-12-larangan-pendayagunaan-air-di-wilayah.html":{"slug":"blog/2020-12-larangan-pendayagunaan-air-di-wilayah.html","filePath":"blog/2020-12-larangan-pendayagunaan-air-di-wilayah.html.md","title":"Larangan Pendayagunaan Air di Wilayah Konservasi Mengancam Industri Geothermal dan Mikrohidro? | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":["assets/pdfs/asset_00017_Policy_Brief_01_2020_IND.pdf"],"tags":[],"content":"Larangan Pendayagunaan Air di Wilayah Konservasi Mengancam Industri Geothermal dan Mikrohidro?\nTuesday, December 15, 2020   Movanet \n\nPolicy Brief 01/20 CRPG yang berjudul “Larangan Pendayagunaan Air di Wilayah Konservasi Mengancam Industri Geothermal dan Mikrohidro?” dapat diunduh disini.\n\n\nPasal 33 UU 17 Tahun 2019 Tentang Sumber Daya Air (UUSDA) melarang pendayagunaan air di wilayah konservasi, kecuali untuk kebutuhan pokok sehari-hari bagi orang perseorangan.

One of the things that is of concern is the simplification of business permit. The concept of risk-based regulation is attractive to simplify the programs due to the assumption that it may cut off a number of licenses. However, the application of risk analysis to screen permits is something different from other countries. In addition, the application of risk-based regulations also needs to pay attention to the critique that is not accommodated in the Law. This paper describes 4 (four) critiques of the application of risk-based regulation in the Law, (i) the omnibus format confuses risk assessment, (ii) volatility risk has not been considered, (iii) systemic risk has not been considered and (iv) potential “regulatory capture”. Conceptually, the application of risk-based regulation has sparked an academic discourse regarding the broad understanding of regulation that has evolved far from the narrow meaning in academic discourse in Indonesia which defines it only as a statutory regulation.\nKeywords: Regulation, Risk Based Ragulation, Job Creation Law, Omnibus\nDownload paper disini.\n Posted by: Movanet \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2021-09-alienating-private-sector-implications.html":{"slug":"blog/2021-09-alienating-private-sector-implications.html","filePath":"blog/2021-09-alienating-private-sector-implications.html.md","title":"Alienating the 'Private' Sector: Implications of the Invalidation of the Water Law by the Indonesian Constitutional Court | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Alienating the ‘Private’ Sector: Implications of the Invalidation of the Water Law by the Indonesian Constitutional Court\nSunday, September 12, 2021   Movanet \nJournal of Water Law 26/3 (2019)\nIn 2015, the Indonesian Constitutional Court invalidated Law no 7 Year 2004 on Water Resources. At the heart of the Judicial Review was the extent of private sector’s involvement in Indonesia’s water sector and the effort to regain “state control” on water resources, as required by the Constitution. In order to realize “state control”, the Constitutional Court decreed that state owned and region owned enterprises should be prioritized in the management of water resources. Further, involvement of private enterprise should be restricted and is only possible after water is allocated to other priorities. Unfortunately the Court did not define what is meant by “private sector”.

These platforms primarily serve as communication and coordination platforms between WASH stakeholders rather than serving to support accountability.\n\n\nThe social network analysis demonstrated high fragmentation and low cohesion across WASH stakeholders, with some WASH organisations having unique networks that they operate within, but which are not shared by other organisations. Donor and aid organisations had more frequent interactions with government compared to local NGOs and research organisations.\n\n\nCurrently there is no mutual accountability mechanism in place between national WASH stakeholders. Rather, there is evidence of accountability occurring internally within organisations or institutions. There is also evidence of accountability from development partner/NGO to the national government, and there are traditional vertical accountability mechanisms, a medium-term development plan to guide overall direction of the sector and mechanisms such as the Ombudsman and regular reporting. However, these do not constitute mutual accountability between WASH stakeholders. The existing multi-stakeholder platforms do not explicitly enable mutual accountability between WASH stakeholders.\n\n\nCOVID-19 did not change the existing accountability mechanisms. However, it changed the way WASH stakeholders communicate. The method of communication shifted from the traditional face-to-face communication to online communication. Online communication was considered to be more flexible, as well as cost and time effective. As such, by utilizing online platform, there is a potential to enhance participation of WASH stakeholders in WASH discussion.\n\n\n5. Most WASH stakeholders had heard about SWA as a global partnership, but they were not aware of its specific activities in Indonesia. This is due to Indonesia’s relatively recent participation in SWA (Indonesia joined SWA in 2017) - as such most non-SWA partner organisations had no or little knowledge about SWA activities – and there was an absence of a multi stakeholder forum to facilitate Indonesia’s commitment in SWA. To increase accountability between WASH stakeholders, a forum that enables mutual accountability mechanism is needed. There is no need to establish a completely new forum as the existing multi-stakeholder forum can be optimized to accommodate this need – it is, however, important to redesign and improve the quality and effectiveness of the existing forum for it to function well. In line with the MAM, Pokja and Jejaring AMPL, which primarily function as a communication and coordination platform, can be redesigned to enable a process to hold stakeholders accountable for their commitments – allowing assessment, reviews, and necessary adjustments to the stakeholders’ performance. The MAM will have the potential to bind its members and enforce commitment implementation provided that there is a high-level support from the President as a reflection of political will as well as SWA’s strong support in the national and global level are essential to achieve this goal.\n\n\nDownload the full report here\n Posted by: Movanet \n   \nNewer Post Older Post Home"},"blog/2022-02-webinar-kick-off-swa-mam-jejaring-ampl.html":{"slug":"blog/2022-02-webinar-kick-off-swa-mam-jejaring-ampl.html","filePath":"blog/2022-02-webinar-kick-off-swa-mam-jejaring-ampl.html.md","title":"Webinar Kick-off SWA & MAM Jejaring AMPL - CRPG | Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Webinar Kick-off SWA &amp; MAM Jejaring AMPL - CRPG\nSunday, February 20, 2022   Agus Setiawan \n\nSanitation and Water for All (SWA) adalah wadah kemitraan global yang didukung United Nations (UN) dengan tujuan untuk mencapai TPB 6.

With the 1.5 degrees Celsius target set by the Paris Agreement likely to be overshot, regulatory frameworks must be designed to help countries and communities adapt to the climate crisis. Climate adaptation is the process of adjusting to current or expected future climate change and its effects. It involves both mitigation and adaptation measures to reduce the risks of climate change, as well as to build resilience and prepare for potential impacts. This includes a range of activities such as improving infrastructure, developing early warning systems, and changing land use and management practices. Climate adaptation strategies must be tailored to the local context, as different regions and communities face different risks and vulnerabilities. For example, coastal communities may need to prepare for sea level rise, while inland communities may need to prepare for drought or flooding. It is also important to consider the needs of vulnerable populations, such as those living in poverty or with limited access to resources. Regulatory frameworks must be designed to support adaptation efforts. This includes setting clear objectives and targets, as well as providing incentives for adaptation. Governments should also ensure that adaptation measures are integrated into national and local policies, and that they are well-funded and implemented. In addition, governments should create an enabling environment for adaptation. This includes removing barriers to adaptation, such as legal and financial constraints, and providing support for capacity building and knowledge sharing. It is also important to ensure that adaptation measures are equitable and just, and that they are tailored to the needs of different communities. Finally, it is important to ensure that adaptation measures are effective and sustainable. This includes monitoring and evaluating progress, as well as ensuring that adaptation measures are adapted as the climate continues to change. Climate adaptation is a complex and challenging issue, but it is essential for countries and communities to prepare for the impacts of climate change.

As the 1.5 degrees Celsius target set by the Paris Agreement is likely to be overshot, regulatory frameworks need to be designed to help communities and nations adapt to the changing climate. Climate adaptation is defined as the process of adjusting to the current and future impacts of climate change. This includes both short-term and long-term measures that can be taken to reduce the risks posed by climate change. Examples of adaptation measures include the use of green infrastructure to reduce flooding, the adoption of drought-resistant crops, and the implementation of early warning systems for extreme weather events. The need for adaptation is becoming increasingly urgent as the impacts of climate change become more severe. Rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and sea level rise are all contributing to the destruction of ecosystems and the displacement of communities. In order to protect people and the environment, adaptation measures must be implemented. The Paris Agreement set a goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. However, recent reports suggest that this target is likely to be overshot, meaning that adaptation measures will become even more important. In order to effectively adapt to the changing climate, governments and other stakeholders must work together to create regulatory frameworks that will enable communities and nations to cope with the impacts of climate change. These frameworks should include policies and measures that will help to reduce the risks posed by climate change, such as the development of green infrastructure and the adoption of drought-resistant crops. In addition, adaptation measures should be tailored to the specific needs of different communities and nations. For example, coastal communities may need to implement measures to protect against sea level rise, while arid regions may need to focus on drought-resistant crops and water conservation. Climate adaptation is an essential part of the fight against the climate crisis. As the 1.5 degrees Celsius target is likely to be overshot, regulatory frameworks must be designed to help communities and nations adapt to the changing climate. These frameworks should include policies and measures that will reduce the risks posed by climate change, as well as measures tailored to the specific needs of different communities and nations.

Theories of Regulatory Adaptation are a set of ideas and principles that can be applied to the study of artificial intelligence and climate change. These theories suggest that the ability to adapt to changing conditions is essential for the successful regulation of both of these complex systems. The first theory of regulatory adaptation is the “adaptive cycle”. This theory suggests that a system will go through a cycle of adaptation and adjustment in order to remain stable. This cycle includes a period of exploration, followed by a period of consolidation, and then a period of adaptation. During the exploration phase, the system will explore different strategies and solutions in order to find the most effective one. During the consolidation phase, the system will refine and improve the chosen strategy. Finally, during the adaptation phase, the system will adjust its strategy in order to cope with changing conditions. The second theory of regulatory adaptation is the “adaptive capacity”. This theory suggests that a system must have the capacity to adapt to changing conditions in order to remain stable. This capacity includes the ability to detect changes in the environment, the ability to adjust its strategies in response to those changes, and the ability to learn from its mistakes. The third theory of regulatory adaptation is the “adaptive resilience”. This theory suggests that a system must be able to recover from disruptions and shocks in order to remain stable. This includes the ability to identify potential risks, the ability to prepare for them, and the ability to recover quickly after they occur. The fourth theory of regulatory adaptation is the “adaptive governance”. This theory suggests that a system must have effective governance structures in order to remain stable. This includes the ability to identify and manage risks, the ability to make decisions quickly and effectively, and the ability to coordinate the actions of different stakeholders. These theories of regulatory adaptation can be applied to both artificial intelligence and climate change. In the case of artificial intelligence, these theories suggest that the ability to adapt to changing conditions is essential for the successful regulation of AI systems. In the case of climate change, these theories suggest that the ability to adapt to changing conditions is essential for the successful regulation of climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. Overall, the theories of regulatory adaptation provide a useful framework for understanding how complex systems can remain stable in the face of changing conditions. By understanding and applying these theories, we can better prepare for and manage the risks associated with artificial intelligence and climate change.\n\nDisclaimer: The content of this blog post has been automatically generated by GPT 3.5, as a part of CRPG’s experiment in using AI systems for legal research.

Theories of Regulatory Adaptation are a set of concepts that are used to explain how systems can adjust to changing conditions. These theories can be applied to a variety of areas, including artificial intelligence and climate change. In this article, we will explore the theories of regulatory adaptation and how they can be used to address the challenges posed by these two topics. The first theory of regulatory adaptation is the “Adaptive Regulation” theory. This theory suggests that systems can adjust to changing conditions by using feedback loops. This means that the system can learn from its own mistakes and adjust its behavior accordingly. This type of regulation is especially useful when dealing with complex systems, such as artificial intelligence and climate change. The second theory of regulatory adaptation is the “Adaptive Governance” theory. This theory suggests that systems can be regulated through a combination of self-regulation and external regulation. Self-regulation involves the system adjusting its behavior in response to feedback from its environment. External regulation involves the system being regulated by an external authority, such as a government or an international organization. This type of regulation is useful when dealing with complex systems, such as artificial intelligence and climate change. The third theory of regulatory adaptation is the “Adaptive Decision-Making” theory. This theory suggests that systems can adjust their behavior in response to changing conditions by using a combination of decision-making algorithms and feedback loops. This type of regulation is especially useful when dealing with complex systems, such as artificial intelligence and climate change. The theories of regulatory adaptation can be used to address the challenges posed by artificial intelligence and climate change. By using these theories, we can better understand how systems can adjust to changing conditions and how we can better regulate them. This can help us create more effective and efficient systems that can better handle the challenges posed by these two topics.\n\nDisclaimer: The content of this blog post has been automatically generated by GPT 3.5, as a part of CRPG’s experiment in using AI systems for legal research.

It covers key parameters such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, nutrients, turbidity, and contaminants. The article provides examples of how changes in these parameters can affect aquatic life and human health. For instance, urban runoff can raise water temperatures, causing thermal pollution, while agricultural runoff can lead to excessive nutrient levels, causing eutrophication and low oxygen levels. The article emphasizes the need for monitoring and regulating these parameters to protect ecosystems and public health.\nThe article titled Water Sector Regulation discusses the various aspects of water services regulation. It covers topics such as the structure of the water services industry, the question of ownership and control, the role of licenses and contracts in regulation, and the unique challenges posed by the natural monopoly character of water service. The article also emphasizes the importance of specific legislation to tackle consumer problems in water services, detailing provisions on duties to supply, supply standards, and customer service. It further discusses the role of legislation in economic regulation and the need for independent, capable regulators. Lastly, the article touches on the importance of demand management and water efficiency, and the role of legislation in these areas.\nCourt decision brings water governance reforms to a halt (Part 1 of 2) discusses the implications of the Indonesian Constitutional Court’s decision to invalidate Law No. 7/2004 on Water Resources. The decision has caused a significant impact on the Indonesian water community, leading to the halt of several planned water projects and threatening ongoing ones. The author argues that the decision has effectively ended water governance in Indonesia, as the framework for conservation and management of water resources no longer exists. The article also highlights the potential negative effects of this decision, such as the lack of regulation for groundwater extractions, which can lead to land subsidence and saltwater intrusions, and the absence of legal basis for flood control. The author expresses concern that the court’s decision could impede the fulfillment of the sustainable development goal of universal access to water and sanitation.\nThe ultimate risks of water privatization. This article discusses the potential risks associated with the privatization of water services, particularly when contracts are concluded with multinational corporations (MNCs). The author outlines three legal arenas that are impacted by such privatization: transnational, national, and contractual. The article argues that privatization can put the government in a legally disadvantageous position, as disputes arising from contracts can be transformed into international investment disputes through bilateral investment treaties, leading to costly international arbitrations. The author also highlights the lack of adequate accountability and responsibility standards for MNCs, which could potentially lead to irrecoverable environmental or labor losses. At the national level, the author criticizes the weak protection of the right to water in Indonesia, noting that the constitution does not explicitly recognize this right and that current regulations do not distinguish water from other infrastructure projects. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for transparency in water governance and public involvement in decision-making processes.\nCan the courts concern over water privatization be justified (Part 2 of 2) This article is the second part of a discussion on the implications of the Indonesian Constitutional Court’s decision to halt water governance reforms. The author delves into the concept of corporatization, a process by which a public, state-owned company behaves like a private sector entity. The article questions the court’s assumption that state control over natural resources is automatically ensured when these resources are managed by state-owned companies. The author argues that this perspective overlooks the capitalist nature of corporations and the potential for state capitalism to emerge. The article also criticizes the court’s decision for not addressing the risks of corporatization. The author suggests that the focus should not be on public versus private ownership, but on how the state regulates and ensures reliable and affordable services. The article concludes by proposing several potential actions for the government, such as creating implementing regulations and evaluating which provisions in the water law and its implementing regulations are problematic.\nThe article titled The new governor and Jakarta’s drinking water problem discusses the challenges faced by Jakarta’s newly installed governor, Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, in addressing the city’s drinking water issues. The article highlights the complexities of water provision, which is a natural/legal/monopoly, and the trade-off between service levels and network expansion. It also discusses the significant costs associated with expanding the network to low-income citizens. The article points out the structural disincentives in connecting to the poor due to the current governance structure of Jakarta’s water services. It suggests that Jokowi should address the lack of incentives from regulatory actors in connecting to the poor, consult the poor on how they want to be connected to the network, and try to reform the existing legislation which penalizes the poor for late payments. The article emphasizes that these challenges should not discourage Jokowi from his initial plan to provide services to the poor.\nIndonesia needs a strong water services law This article emphasizes the need for a robust water services law in Indonesia. The author points out that only a small portion of the population has access to piped water and that the lack of sanitation contributes to significant economic losses and health issues. The article criticizes the current water law for its vague and broad regulation of water services, which can lead to legal complications when dealing with large-scale water projects involving multinational corporations and foreign lenders. The author argues that the governance of water resources and water services should be treated differently, as they deal with distinct aspects of water management. The article also highlights the importance of a water services law in protecting consumers from service disconnection, establishing a consultation mechanism for tariff setting, setting quality standards for drinking water, and detailing consumer rights. The author concludes by stating that without a water services law, the rights of consumers and investors are not legally guaranteed and are subject to the mercy of local governments.\nRI water services suffering from a lack of governance This article discusses the lack of governance in Indonesia’s water services. The author notes that while funds are available for investment by the private sector, most private sector participation in the water sector is failing. The article criticizes the focus on public versus private ownership of water utilities, arguing that the real question should be about what governance mechanisms work for either public or private water utilities. The author also points out that both privatized and non-privatized services are developing without adequate governance. The article highlights the situation in Jakarta, where water services are regulated mainly through concession contracts, which do not reflect the need to incorporate post-privatization reality and do not provide clear rights for water customers. The author concludes by emphasizing the need for local governments to establish a framework for transparency, accountability, and participation through regional bylaws, especially when services are to be privatized.\nThe article titled Assimilative Capacity — Understanding Nature’s Ability To Absorb Impacts discusses the concept of assimilative capacity, which refers to the ability of a natural system to absorb, process, or neutralize pollutants, waste, or disturbances without significant adverse effects. The article emphasizes the importance of understanding assimilative capacity for effective environmental policies and strategies that protect natural resources and promote sustainable development. It provides a definition of assimilative capacity and explains its importance in environmental management, including the protection of ecosystems, maintenance of ecosystem services, and promotion of sustainable resource use. The article also provides examples of assimilative capacity in different environmental systems, such as river systems, airsheds, and coastal ecosystems. These examples illustrate how managing pollutant discharges and waste production based on assimilative capacity can help protect water quality, maintain air quality, and preserve the ecological functions of coastal ecosystems.\n Posted by: Movanet \n   \nOlder Post Home"},"docs/aiira/aiirareport8072016":{"slug":"docs/aiira/aiirareport8072016","filePath":"docs/aiira/aiirareport8072016.md","title":"Page not found","links":[],"tags":["crpg","programs"],"content":"This page could not be found!\nWe are sorry.

Paparan merkuri dapat menyebabkan gangguan pada sistem saraf, sistem pencernaan, sistem kekebalan tubuh, dan gangguan pada organ tubuh seperti paru-paru, ginjal, mata dan kulit. Merkuri berasal dari batu sinabar yang dimurnikan. Batu sinabar merupakan bentuk primer dari merkuri dan dapat ditemukan di lingkungan secara alami. Di Indonesia batu sinabar terdapat di Pulau Seram, Maluku.\nMengingat bahaya merkuri, pada 10 Oktober 2013 negara-negara di dunia menandatangani Konvensi Minamata tentang Merkuri. Konvensi ini bermaksud untuk melindungi kesehatan manusia dan lingkungan dari emisi antropogenik lepasan merkuri dan senyawanya. Konvensi Minamata memuat ketentuan-ketentuan yang terkait dengan siklus hidup merkuri, termasuk pengendalian dan pengurangannya dalam berbagai produk, proses dan industri. Disamping itu, Konvensi tersebut juga membahas penambangan sinabar serta impir dan ekspor merkuri, termasuk penyimpanan dan pengelolaan yang aman.\nPemerintah Indonesia telah meratifikasi Konvensi Minamata mengenai Merkuri (Minamata Convention on Mercury) melalui UU No. 11 tahun 2017.

Mulia was primarily trained in fish processing technology at Bogor Agricultural University (IPB), where she graduated as National Most Outstanding Student. She furthered her study in Norway in 2006, and was graduated in 2008 as the second best student in the Master of International Fishery Management program from Norwegian School of Fishery Science, University of Tromso.\nMulia worked with UN FAO Tsunami Response Team from 2005-2006, restoring the livelihood of fish traders and fish processors impacted by the disaster. She was among the first national consultant in post-harvest fishery in Aceh, as well as the first woman consultant in UN FAO Fishery team in Aceh. It was after her mission, that the post-harvest fishery sector in Aceh started to gain attention from donors around the world. Upon completing her master degree, Mulia returned back to Aceh and worked with UNDP and UN FAO. In 2009, she brought Aceh fish traders to five countries in Malaysia for training and field visit. The fish traders on training are now re-established and have expanded their business.\nIn 2010, Mulia started her PhD in Denmark as part of WinFood project, testing the efficacy of fish based complementary food, specifically in whole blood fatty acid content. In this research project, Mulia, together with the WinFood team, sampled blood from 400 Cambodian infants, before and after they were fed with fish based complementary food for nine months. After the intervention study was completed, Mulia conducted an economic study to understand Cambodian’s willingness to pay for the fish-based complementary food, as well as their knowledge on nutrition and child feeding. As a researcher Mulia has published in internationally recognized journal, namely Food Composition and Analysis and Maternal and Child Nutrition. Mulia is fluent in English and Bahasa, with fair understanding in German.\nMulia’s passion is to help the poor and the marginalized people. Her decade of dedication to fishery has been based on her altruism. Fishers and people living in coastal areas are often, the most marginalized, poor and uneducated communities. And fish as well as other aquatic animals are arguably the most available source of protein and fatty acids for the poor. Mulia wishes to use her knowledge in fishery and nutrition to give back to the fishing communities."},"people/richo-wibowo":{"slug":"people/richo-wibowo","filePath":"people/richo-wibowo.md","title":"Richo Wibowo","links":["cdn-cgi/l/email-protection"],"tags":["people","crpg","anggota"],"content":"Richo Wibowo, SH, LL.M\nLecturer at the faculty of law Universitas Gadjah Mada; Affiliated Researcher at the Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG)\n Envelope __\nExpertise and Research Interest: Administrative Law, Good Governance, Procurement, Comparative Law, Corruption\nRicho obtained his Bachelor of Laws (S.H) from Faculty of Law, Universitas Islam Indonesia in 2006.

Several multilateral organizations such as the World Bank Group, the Asian Development Bank and the OECD have formalized their partnership with the OGP.\nEleven countries in the Asia Pacific region are members of the OGP: Afghanistan, South Korea, Philipines, Armenia, Georgia, Indonesia, Jordan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea and Srilanka. Some are in the process of developing their national action plans and some are currently in the process of implementing it.\nThe demands toward openness in the Asia Pacific region comes parallel with its economic growth. As Asia Pacific countries are heading towards stronger economies, there is a stronger demand for more efficient, transparent and accountable institutions. Through the action plans, the OGP facilitates Asia Pacific countries in building stronger institutions necessary for their economic development. However, countries can only join the OGP if they satisfy the “eligibility criteria” which includes budget transparency, access to information, income and assets disclosure as well as citizen engagement. Thus, countries interested in joining OGP must improve their eligibility score. The Open Government Partnership rests on the “theory of change” which consist of three elements essential for realizing open government reforms: high-level political commitment, empowering government reformers and supporting effective engagement by civil societies, all as part of each countries’ OGP cycle from action plan development to implementation and evaluation.\nThis project reinforce OGP’s theory of change by bringing government reformers and civil society activists from Afghanistan, South Korea, Philipines, Armenia, Georgia, Indonesia, Jordan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea and Srilanka together through a series of program designed to enable these open government actors to learn from the successes and failures in conducting reforms from their peers.\nActors from non-OGP countries in the Asia Pacific, such as CSOs in Nepal and China who have expressed their interest in joining the OGP learning community will also benefit from the program by understanding how countries can conduct reform process which improves their eligibility score in order to join the OGP.\n\nThe goal of this program is to enhance the capacity of government reformers and civil society activists in both member and non-OGP member countries in Asia Pacific through peer to peer learning exchange.\n\nIn order to realize such goals, CRPG will organize a series of peer to peer learning events:\nPeer to peer learning workshop on Open Budgeting and Open Contracting, in Jakarta, 13 December 2017 and breakout session 2 of the Asia Pacific Leaders Forum (APLF) : “Rebuilding Trust in Government”, Jakarta, 14 December 2017 [See event page]\nAccess to Information Workshop (in collaboration with the OGP Support Unit)\nMulti-Stakeholder Forum on Open Government\nThe above events are supported by funding from the Ford Foundation and conducted in collaboration with civil societies, the Open Government Partnership Support Unit and the Indonesian Ministry of Planning (Bappenas).\nIf you or your organization are concerned with Open Government topics and would like to participate, please contact our program officer Mr. Muhammad Maulana [maulkhan(at)gmail(dot)com]"},"programs/swa-mam-catalytic-program":{"slug":"programs/swa-mam-catalytic-program","filePath":"programs/swa-mam-catalytic-program.md","title":"SWA MAM Catalytic Program","links":["assets/images/2022/05/W1-1-Bappenas.pdf","assets/images/2022/05/Webinar-1-Materi-Siddhartha-Das.pdf","assets/images/2022/06/Notulensi-Webinar-1.pdf","assets/images/2022/05/W2-1-Series-Jejaring-MAM-Lembaga-Riset.pdf","assets/images/2022/05/W2-2-Jejaring-AMPL-Jembatan-Pengetahuan.pdf","assets/images/2022/05/W2-3-Webinar-Jejaring-AMPL-R_D-WASH-Indonesia.pdf","assets/images/2022/05/W2-4-UNICEF-water-sanitation-and-hygiene-research-agenda-06042022.pdf","assets/images/2022/05/W2-5-Trends-WASH-research-Indonesia.pdf","assets/images/2022/06/Notulensi-Webinar-2.pdf","assets/images/2022/05/W3-1-Nur-Aisyah.pdf","assets/images/2022/05/W3-2-Adaro.pdf","assets/images/2022/05/W3-3-ASTRA.pdf","assets/images/2022/05/W3-5-PZ-Cussons.pdf","assets/images/2022/05/W3-7-Yayasan-Buddha-Tzu-Chi_com.pdf","assets/images/2022/06/W3-8-Baznas..pdf","assets/images/2022/05/W3-Bappenas-New-Commitments-v5.pdf","assets/images/2022/06/Notulensi-Webinar-3.pdf","assets/images/2022/06/W4-1-Jejaring-MAM-Investasi-Bisnis.pdf","assets/images/2022/05/W4-Komitmen-dari-Pelaku-Usaha_WO.xlsx","assets/images/2022/06/Notulensi-Webinar-4.pdf"],"tags":["crpg","programs"],"content":"Sanitation and Water for all (SWA) Mutual Accountability Mechanism (MAM) Catalytic Program\n**Dissemination Webinar\n**on Sanitation and Water for All (SWA) and National Mutual Accountability Mechanism (MMA)\n!\nLink Video Webinar dapat dilihat Pada Link Berikut :(Open Here)\n**Webinar Seri I\nKomitmen Pembangunan Air dan Sanitasi oleh OrganisasiMasyarakat sipil di Indonesia**\n!\nMateri Webinar dapat diunduh Pada Link Berikut :\n\nNur Aisyah Nasution , DIREKTORAT PERUMAHAN DAN PERMUKIMAN KEMENTERIAN PPN/BAPPENAS.

In Indonesia, there is yet a forum where researchers and academics in the WASH sector could exchange ideas academically and discuss the latest insights in science, technology and the governance of this sector.\nThis event is also needed to collate various scientific evidence and the latest research. In addition, through “policy synthesis”, this symposium is expected to advocate scientific findings in order to provide input for future evidence-based policies in the Indonesian WASH Sector.\nThe Symposium will be conducted Virtually (online-only) with a focus on Indonesia’s Effort in Realizing Access to Safe, Inclusive, Sustainable and Climate-resilient Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for All. Any abstract related or relevant to Indonesia’s effort – or a comparative analysis involving Indonesia and other countries — in achieving SDGs Target on WASH is welcome.\nThe Symposium is Bilingual (in English and Bahasa Indonesia). The Opening and Closing Plenary will be in English (with interpretation in Bahasa Indonesia) and the rest of the sessions will be organized into Bahasa Indonesia sessions and English sessions (both without interpretation).\nOutput\n\nExtended Abstract (Proceeding/ISBN) and Policy Synthesis, Editor: Cindy Priadi, Daniel and Mohamad Mova Al’Afghani\nPublication at IWA Journals (subject to further peer review)\n\nObjectives\n\nStrengthen Pentahelix network and collaboration in WASH-related research in Indonesia\nConsolidate scientific evidence related to WASH in Indonesia\nIdentify current and future WASH research topics in Indonesia\n\nTarget Participants\n\nResearchers/Lecturers\nUniversity students\nNational, provincial and local governments\nPractitioners\nNGOs\nNational and international donors\nWASH-related industries\n\nSymposium Format\nOnline in the form of presentation sessions and posters.
