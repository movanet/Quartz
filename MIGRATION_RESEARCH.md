# CRPG.INFO Content Migration Research Report

**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Target Site:** https://crpg.info
**Organization:** Center for Regulation Policy and Governance (CRPG)
**Migration Goal:** Migrate to GitHub Pages using Quartz static site generator

---

## Executive Summary

The Center for Regulation Policy and Governance (CRPG) website at crpg.info is a research organization based in Indonesia. The site requires migration to a modern static site platform using Quartz. Direct web scraping is currently blocked by anti-bot protection (403 Forbidden errors), requiring alternative approaches for content extraction.

**Recommendation:** Site owner cooperation is required. The most efficient path is to export content directly from the WordPress backend or database.

---

## 1. Current Situation Analysis

### 1.1 Existing Scraper Script Analysis

**Location:** `/home/user/Quartz/scrape_crpg.py`

**Script Characteristics:**
- Basic web scraper using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`
- Includes comprehensive browser headers to mimic a real browser
- Implements polite crawling with 1-second delays
- Converts HTML to Markdown using `html2text`
- Generates basic Quartz-compatible frontmatter

**Why Scraping is Failing:**

1. **Anti-Bot Protection (403 Forbidden)**
   - Despite using realistic User-Agent headers and browser fingerprints
   - The site likely uses:
     - IP-based rate limiting
     - JavaScript challenge pages (e.g., Cloudflare, Wordfence)
     - Cookie/session validation
     - Advanced bot detection (TLS fingerprinting, header analysis)

2. **Technical Limitations:**
   - Static HTTP requests cannot execute JavaScript
   - No cookie/session handling for dynamic protection
   - Cannot solve CAPTCHA challenges
   - Limited to basic header spoofing

3. **Ethical Considerations:**
   - The 403 response indicates the site owner has implemented bot blocking
   - Attempting to bypass protection may violate terms of service
   - Could trigger IP bans or legal concerns

## 3. Recommended Approach

### Primary Strategy: WordPress Export + Owner Cooperation

**Recommended Path:**

1. **Initial Contact with Site Owner**
   - Send formal migration request (see template below)
   - Explain benefits: faster load times, better security, version control
   - Offer technical assistance

2. **Content Export Phase**
   - Request WordPress XML export (Tools → Export)
   - Request media library files (wp-content/uploads)
   - Optional: Request database export for custom fields

3. **Technical Implementation**
   - Parse WordPress WXR XML format
   - Convert posts/pages to Markdown
   - Map WordPress metadata to Quartz frontmatter
   - Download and organize media assets
   - Preserve URL structure for SEO

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Verify all content migrated
   - Check internal links
   - Validate frontmatter
   - Test media rendering
   - Compare with original site

### Fallback Strategy 1: WordPress REST API

If XML export is unavailable, attempt API access:

```bash
# Test API availability
curl https://crpg.info/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?per_page=1

# If successful, implement API scraper
```

### Fallback Strategy 2: Selective Manual Migration

If all automated methods fail:
- Identify high-priority content (homepage, key research papers, contact info)
- Manually migrate critical pages first
- Create placeholder pages for low-priority content
- Iterative approach over time

---

## 6. Migration Tools & Scripts

### 6.1 WordPress XML to Markdown Converter

**Recommended Libraries:**

**Python:**
- `wordpress-export-parser` - Parse WXR XML
- `python-frontmatter` - Handle YAML frontmatter
- `html2text` - Convert HTML to Markdown
- `beautifulsoup4` - Clean HTML before conversion

**Example Script Structure:**
```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
import frontmatter
import html2text
from pathlib import Path

def parse_wordpress_export(xml_file):
    """Parse WordPress WXR XML and extract posts/pages"""
    tree = ET.parse(xml_file)
    root = tree.getroot()

    items = []
    for item in root.findall('.//item'):
        post_data = {
            'title': item.find('title').text,
            'content': item.find('{http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/}encoded').text,
            'date': item.find('pubDate').text,
            'slug': item.find('{http://wordpress.org/export/1.2/}post_name').text,
            'post_type': item.find('{http://wordpress.org/export/1.2/}post_type').text,
            'categories': [cat.text for cat in item.findall('category')],
            'tags': [tag.text for tag in item.findall('category[@domain="post_tag"]')],
        }
        items.append(post_data)

    return items

def convert_to_markdown(post_data, output_dir):
    """Convert post to Markdown with frontmatter"""
    h2t = html2text.HTML2Text()
    h2t.ignore_links = False
    h2t.body_width = 0

    content = h2t.handle(post_data['content'])

    post = frontmatter.Post(content)
    post.metadata = {
        'title': post_data['title'],
        'date': post_data['date'],
        'tags': post_data['tags'],
        'categories': post_data['categories'],
        'migrated_from': 'wordpress',
    }

    # Save to file
    filepath = Path(output_dir) / f"{post_data['slug']}.md"
    with open(filepath, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(frontmatter.dumps(post))
```

### 6.2 WordPress REST API Scraper

```python
import requests
import json
from pathlib import Path

def fetch_wordpress_posts(base_url, post_type='posts'):
    """Fetch all posts via REST API with pagination"""
    posts = []
    page = 1
    per_page = 100

    while True:
        url = f"{base_url}/wp-json/wp/v2/{post_type}"
        params = {'page': page, 'per_page': per_page}

        response = requests.get(url, params=params)

        if response.status_code != 200:
            break

        batch = response.json()
        if not batch:
            break

        posts.extend(batch)
        page += 1

    return posts
```
